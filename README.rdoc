Instigator is a search engine, based off of the open source code for mtg.wtf, for the Magic Set Editor Modern (MSEM) format. 




When a new set comes out:
1) Add it's JSON to "data/sets", then run "rake index". 
2) This will populate the database with the cards.
3) Afterwards, "rake pics:MSEM" will download all the new images
3a)When cards are edited, remember to delete their images
4)Add it to "search-engine/lib/format/msem2" and "search-engine/lib/format/msedh"
