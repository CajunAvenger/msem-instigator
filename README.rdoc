Instigator is a search engine, based off of the open source code for mtg.wtf, for the Magic Set Editor Modern (MSEM) format. 




When a new set comes out:

1) Add it's JSON to "data/sets", then run "rake index". 

2) This will populate the database with the cards.

3)Add it to "search-engine/lib/format/msem2" and "search-engine/lib/format/msedh"
