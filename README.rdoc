When a new set comes out:
-Add it's JSON to "data/sets", then run "rake index". 
-This will populate the database with the cards.
-Afterwards, "rake pics:MSEM" will download all the new images
--When cards are edited, remember to delete their images
-Add it to "search-engine/lib/format/msem2" and "search-engine/lib/format/msedh"
