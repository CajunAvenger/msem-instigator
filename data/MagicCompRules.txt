<a id="cr1"><b>1. Game Concepts</b></a><p><a id="cr100"><b>100. General</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr100.1"><b>100.1.</b></a> These Magic rules apply to any Magic game with two or more players, including two-player games and multiplayer games.</p>
<p><a id="cr100.1a"><b>100.1a</b></a> A two-player game is a game that begins with only two players.</p>
<p><a id="cr100.1b"><b>100.1b</b></a> A multiplayer game is a game that begins with more than two players. See <a href="#cr8">section 8</a>, “Multiplayer Rules.”</p>
<p><a id="cr100.2"><b>100.2.</b></a> To play, each player needs their own deck of traditional Magic cards, small items to represent any tokens and counters, and some way to clearly track life totals.</p>
<p><a id="cr100.2a"><b>100.2a</b></a> In constructed play (a way of playing in which each player creates their own deck ahead of time), each deck has a minimum deck size of 60 cards. A constructed deck may contain any number of basic land cards and no more than four of any card with a particular English name other than basic land cards. For the purposes of deck construction, cards with interchangeable names have the same English name (see rule <a href="#cr201.3">201.3</a>).</p>
<p><a id="cr100.2b"><b>100.2b</b></a> In limited play (a way of playing in which each player gets the same quantity of unopened Magic product such as booster packs and creates their own deck using only this product and basic land cards), each deck has a minimum deck size of 40 cards. A limited deck may contain as many duplicates of a card as are included with the product.</p>
<p><a id="cr100.2c"><b>100.2c</b></a> Commander decks are subject to additional deckbuilding restrictions and requirements. See rule <a href="#cr903">903</a>, “Commander,” for details.</p>
<p><a id="cr100.3"><b>100.3.</b></a> Some cards require coins or traditional dice. Some casual variants require additional items, such as specially designated cards, nontraditional Magic cards, and specialized dice.</p>
<p><a id="cr100.4"><b>100.4.</b></a> Each player may also have a sideboard, which is a group of additional cards the player may use to modify their deck between games of a match.</p>
<p><a id="cr100.4a"><b>100.4a</b></a> In constructed play, a sideboard may contain no more than fifteen cards. The four-card limit (see rule <a href="#cr100.2a">100.2a</a>) applies to the combined deck and sideboard.</p>
<p><a id="cr100.4b"><b>100.4b</b></a> In limited play involving individual players, all cards in a player’s card pool not included in their deck are in that player’s sideboard.</p>
<p><a id="cr100.4c"><b>100.4c</b></a> In limited play involving the Two-Headed Giant multiplayer variant, all cards in a team’s card pool but not in either player’s deck are in that team’s sideboard.</p>
<p><a id="cr100.4d"><b>100.4d</b></a> In limited play involving other multiplayer team variants, each card in a team’s card pool but not in any player’s deck is assigned to the sideboard of one of those players. Each player has their own sideboard; cards may not be transferred between players.</p>
<p><a id="cr100.5"><b>100.5.</b></a> If a deck must contain at least a certain number of cards, that number is referred to as a minimum deck size. There is no maximum deck size for non-Commander decks.</p>
<p><a id="cr100.6"><b>100.6.</b></a> Most Magic tournaments (organized play activities where players compete against other players to win prizes) have additional rules covered in the Magic: The Gathering Tournament Rules (found at WPN.Wizards.com/en/resources/rules-documents). These rules may limit the use of some cards, including barring all cards from some older sets.</p>
<p><a id="cr100.6a"><b>100.6a</b></a> Tournaments usually consist of a series of matches. A two-player match usually involves playing until one player has won two games. A multiplayer match usually consists of only one game.</p>
<p><a id="cr100.6b"><b>100.6b</b></a> Players can use the Magic Store & Event Locator at Wizards.com/Locator to find tournaments in their area.</p>
<p><a id="cr100.7"><b>100.7.</b></a> Certain promotional cards and cards in the Unglued, Unhinged, and Unstable sets are printed with a silver border. These cards are intended for casual play and may have features and text that aren’t covered by these rules.</p>
<p><a id="cr101"><b>101. The Magic Golden Rules</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr101.1"><b>101.1.</b></a> Whenever a card’s text directly contradicts these rules, the card takes precedence. The card overrides only the rule that applies to that specific situation. The only exception is that a player can concede the game at any time (see rule <a href="#cr104.3a">104.3a</a>).</p>
<p><a id="cr101.2"><b>101.2.</b></a> When a rule or effect allows or directs something to happen, and another effect states that it can’t happen, the “can’t” effect takes precedence.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> If one effect reads “You may play an additional land this turn” and another reads “You can’t play lands this turn,” the effect that precludes you from playing lands wins.</p>
<p><a id="cr101.2a"><b>101.2a</b></a> Adding abilities to objects and removing abilities from objects don’t fall under this rule. (See rule <a href="#cr113.10">113.10</a>.)</p>
<p><a id="cr101.3"><b>101.3.</b></a> Any part of an instruction that’s impossible to perform is ignored. (In many cases the card will specify consequences for this; if it doesn’t, there’s no effect.)</p>
<p><a id="cr101.4"><b>101.4.</b></a> If multiple players would make choices and/or take actions at the same time, the active player (the player whose turn it is) makes any choices required, then the next player in turn order (usually the player seated to the active player’s left) makes any choices required, followed by the remaining nonactive players in turn order. Then the actions happen simultaneously. This rule is often referred to as the “Active Player, Nonactive Player (APNAP) order” rule.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> A card reads “Each player sacrifices a creature.” First, the active player chooses a creature they control. Then each of the nonactive players, in turn order, chooses a creature they control. Then all creatures chosen this way are sacrificed simultaneously.</p>
<p><a id="cr101.4a"><b>101.4a</b></a> If an effect has each player choose a card in a hidden zone, such as their hand or library, those cards may remain face down as they’re chosen. However, each player must clearly indicate which face-down card they are choosing.</p>
<p><a id="cr101.4b"><b>101.4b</b></a> A player knows the choices made by the previous players when making their choice, except as specified in 101.4a.</p>
<p><a id="cr101.4c"><b>101.4c</b></a> If a player would make more than one choice at the same time, the player makes the choices in the order specified. If no order is specified, the player chooses the order.</p>
<p><a id="cr101.4d"><b>101.4d</b></a> If a choice made by a nonactive player causes the active player, or a different nonactive player earlier in the turn order, to have to make a choice, APNAP order is restarted for all outstanding choices.</p>
<p><a id="cr101.4e"><b>101.4e</b></a> If multiple players would make choices or take actions while starting the game, the starting player is considered the active player and each other player is considered a nonactive player.</p>
<p><b>★</b> <a id="cr101.5"><b>101.5.</b></a> Whenever an object's text directly contradicts these rules, the object takes precedence. The object overrides only the rule that applies to that specific situation. The only exception is that a player can concede the game at any time (see rule <a href="#cr104.3a">104.3a</a>).</p>
<p><a id="cr102"><b>102. Players</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr102.1"><b>102.1.</b></a> A player is one of the people in the game. The active player is the player whose turn it is. The other players are nonactive players.</p>
<p><a id="cr102.2"><b>102.2.</b></a> In a two-player game, a player’s opponent is the other player.</p>
<p><a id="cr102.3"><b>102.3.</b></a> In a multiplayer game between teams, a player’s teammates are the other players on their team, and the player’s opponents are all players not on their team.</p>
<p><a id="cr102.4"><b>102.4.</b></a> A spell or ability may use the term “your team” as shorthand for “you and/or your teammates.” In a game that isn’t a multiplayer game between teams, “your team” means the same thing as “you.”</p>
<p><a id="cr103"><b>103. Starting the Game</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr103.1"><b>103.1.</b></a> At the start of a game, the players determine which one of them will choose who takes the first turn. In the first game of a match (including a single-game match), the players may use any mutually agreeable method (flipping a coin, rolling dice, etc.) to do so. In a match of several games, the loser of the previous game chooses who takes the first turn. If the previous game was a draw, the player who made the choice in that game makes the choice in this game. The player chosen to take the first turn is the starting player. The game’s default turn order begins with the starting player and proceeds clockwise.</p>
<p><a id="cr103.1a"><b>103.1a</b></a> In a game using the shared team turns option, there is a starting team rather than a starting player.</p>
<p><a id="cr103.1b"><b>103.1b</b></a> In an Archenemy game, these methods aren’t used to determine who takes the first turn. Rather, the archenemy takes the first turn.</p>
<p><a id="cr103.1c"><b>103.1c</b></a> One card (Power Play) states that its controller is the starting player. This effect applies after this determination has happened and supersedes these methods.</p>
<p><a id="cr103.2"><b>103.2.</b></a> After the starting player has been determined, each player shuffles their deck so that the cards are in a random order. Each player may then shuffle or cut their opponents’ decks. The players’ decks become their libraries.</p>
<p><a id="cr103.2a"><b>103.2a</b></a> If a player is using a sideboard (see rule <a href="#cr100.4">100.4</a>) or cards being represented by substitute cards (see rule <a href="#cr714">714</a>), those cards are set aside before shuffling.</p>
<p><a id="cr103.2b"><b>103.2b</b></a> If a player wishes to reveal a card with a companion ability that they own from outside the game, they may do so after setting aside their sideboard. A player may reveal no more than one card this way, and they may do so only if their deck fulfills the condition of that card’s companion ability. (See rule <a href="#cr702.139">702.139</a>, “Companion.”)</p>
<p><a id="cr103.2c"><b>103.2c</b></a> In a Commander game, each player puts their commander from their deck face up into the command zone after having the opportunity to reveal a card with a companion ability and before shuffling. See rule <a href="#cr903.6">903.6</a>.</p>
<p><a id="cr103.2d"><b>103.2d</b></a> In a Conspiracy Draft game, each player puts any number of conspiracy cards from their sideboard into the command zone before shuffling. See rule <a href="#cr905.4">905.4</a>.</p>
<p><a id="cr103.3"><b>103.3.</b></a> Each player begins the game with a starting life total of 20. Some variant games have different starting life totals.</p>
<p><a id="cr103.3a"><b>103.3a</b></a> In a Two-Headed Giant game, each team’s starting life total is 30.</p>
<p><a id="cr103.3b"><b>103.3b</b></a> In a Vanguard game, each player’s starting life total is 20 plus or minus the life modifier of their vanguard card.</p>
<p><a id="cr103.3c"><b>103.3c</b></a> In a Commander game, each player’s starting life total is 40.</p>
<p><a id="cr103.3d"><b>103.3d</b></a> In a two-player Brawl game, each player’s starting life total is 25. In a multiplayer Brawl game, each player’s starting life total is 30.</p>
<p><a id="cr103.3e"><b>103.3e</b></a> In an Archenemy game, the archenemy’s starting life total is 40.</p>
<p><a id="cr103.4"><b>103.4.</b></a> Each player draws a number of cards equal to their starting hand size, which is normally seven. (Some effects can modify a player’s starting hand size.) A player who is dissatisfied with their initial hand may take a mulligan. First, the starting player declares whether they will take a mulligan. Then each other player in turn order does the same. Once each player has made a declaration, all players who decided to take mulligans do so at the same time. To take a mulligan, a player shuffles the cards in their hand back into their library, draws a new hand of cards equal to their starting hand size, then puts a number of those cards equal to the number of times that player has taken a mulligan on the bottom of their library in any order. Once a player chooses not to take a mulligan, the remaining cards become that player’s opening hand, and that player may not take any further mulligans. This process is then repeated until no player takes a mulligan. A player can take mulligans until their opening hand would be zero cards, after which they may not take further mulligans.</p>
<p><a id="cr103.4a"><b>103.4a</b></a> In a Vanguard game, each player’s starting hand size is seven plus or minus the hand modifier of their vanguard card.</p>
<p><a id="cr103.4b"><b>103.4b</b></a> If an effect allows a player to perform an action “any time [that player] could mulligan,” the player may perform that action at a time they would declare whether they will take a mulligan. This need not be in the first round of mulligans. Other players may have already made their mulligan declarations by the time the player has the option to perform this action. If the player performs the action, they then declare whether they will take a mulligan.</p>
<p><a id="cr103.4c"><b>103.4c</b></a> In a multiplayer game and in any Brawl game, the first mulligan a player takes doesn’t count toward the number of cards that player will put on the bottom of their library or the number of mulligans that player may take. Subsequent mulligans are counted toward these numbers as normal.</p>
<p><a id="cr103.4d"><b>103.4d</b></a> In a multiplayer game using the shared team turns option, first each player on the starting team declares whether that player will take a mulligan, then the players on each other team in turn order do the same. Teammates may consult while making their decisions. Then all mulligans are taken at the same time. A player may take a mulligan even after a teammate has decided to keep their opening hand.</p>
<p><a id="cr103.5"><b>103.5.</b></a> Some cards allow a player to take actions with them from their opening hand.

Effects may also make a colored object become colorless.</p>
<p><a id="cr105.4"><b>105.4.</b></a> If a player is asked to choose a color, they must choose one of the five colors. “Multicolored” is not a color. Neither is “colorless.”</p>

<p><a id="cr106"><b>106. Mana</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr106.1"><b>106.1.</b></a> Mana is the primary resource in the game. Players spend mana to pay costs, usually when casting spells and activating abilities.</p>
<p><a id="cr106.1a"><b>106.1a</b></a> There are five colors of mana: white, blue, black, red, and green.</p>
<p><a id="cr106.1b"><b>106.1b</b></a> There are six types of mana: white, blue, black, red, green, and colorless.</p>
<p><a id="cr106.2"><b>106.2.</b></a> Mana is represented by mana symbols (see rule <a href="#cr107.4">107.4</a>). Mana symbols also represent mana costs (see rule <a href="#cr202">202</a>).</p>
<p><a id="cr106.3"><b>106.3.</b></a> Mana is produced by the effects of mana abilities (see rule <a href="#cr605">605</a>). It may also be produced by the effects of spells, as well as by the effects of abilities that aren’t mana abilities. A spell or ability that produces mana instructs a player to add that mana. If mana is produced by a spell, the source of that mana is that spell. If mana is produced by an ability, the source of that mana is the source of that ability (see rule <a href="#cr113.7">113.7</a>).</p>
<p><a id="cr106.4"><b>106.4.</b></a> When an effect instructs a player to add mana, that mana goes into a player’s mana pool. From there, it can be used to pay costs immediately, or it can stay in the player’s mana pool as unspent mana. Each player’s mana pool empties at the end of each step and phase, and the player is said to lose this mana. Cards with abilities that produce mana or refer to unspent mana have received errata in the Oracle™ card reference to no longer explicitly refer to the mana pool.</p>
<p><a id="cr106.4a"><b>106.4a</b></a> If any mana remains in a player’s mana pool after mana is spent to pay a cost, that player announces what mana is still there.</p>
<p><a id="cr106.4b"><b>106.4b</b></a> If a player passes priority (see rule <a href="#cr117">117</a>) while there is mana in their mana pool, that player announces what mana is there.</p>
<p><a id="cr106.5"><b>106.5.</b></a> If an ability would produce one or more mana of an undefined type, it produces no mana instead.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Meteor Crater has the ability “{T}: Choose a color of a permanent you control. Add one mana of that color.” If you control no colored permanents, activating Meteor Crater’s mana ability produces no mana.</p>
<p><a id="cr106.6"><b>106.6.</b></a> Some spells or abilities that produce mana restrict how that mana can be spent, have an additional effect that affects the spell or ability that mana is spent on, or create a delayed triggered ability (see rule <a href="#cr603.7a">603.7a</a>) that triggers when that mana is spent. This doesn’t affect the mana’s type.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> A player’s mana pool contains {R}{G} which can be spent only to cast creature spells. That player activates Doubling Cube’s ability, which reads “{3}, {T}: Double the amount of each type of unspent mana you have.” The player’s mana pool now has {R}{R}{G}{G} in it, {R}{G} of which can be spent on anything.</p>
<p><a id="cr106.6a"><b>106.6a</b></a> Some replacement effects increase the amount of mana produced by a spell or ability. In these cases, any restrictions or additional effects created by the spell or ability will apply to all mana produced. If the spell or ability creates a delayed triggered ability that triggers when the mana is spent, a separate delayed triggered ability is created for each mana produced. If the spell or ability creates a continuous effect or replacement effect if the mana is spent, a separate effect is created once for each mana produced.</p>
<p><a id="cr106.7"><b>106.7.</b></a> Some abilities produce mana based on the type of mana another permanent or permanents “could produce.” The type of mana a permanent could produce at any time includes any type of mana that an ability of that permanent would produce if the ability were to resolve at that time, taking into account any applicable replacement effects in any possible order. Ignore whether any costs of the ability could or could not be paid. If that permanent wouldn’t produce any mana under these conditions, or no type of mana can be defined this way, there’s no type of mana it could produce.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Exotic Orchard has the ability “{T}: Add one mana of any color that a land an opponent controls could produce.” If your opponent controls no lands, activating Exotic Orchard’s mana ability will produce no mana. The same is true if you and your opponent each control no lands other than Exotic Orchards. However, if you control a Forest and an Exotic Orchard, and your opponent controls an Exotic Orchard, then each Exotic Orchard could produce {G}.</p>
<p><a id="cr106.8"><b>106.8.</b></a> If an effect would add mana represented by a hybrid mana symbol to a player’s mana pool, that player chooses one half of that symbol. If a colored half is chosen, one mana of that color is added to that player’s mana pool. If a generic half is chosen, an amount of colorless mana represented by that half’s number is added to that player’s mana pool.</p>
<p><a id="cr106.9"><b>106.9.</b></a> If an effect would add mana represented by a Phyrexian mana symbol to a player’s mana pool, one mana of the color of that symbol is added to that player’s mana pool.</p>
<p><a id="cr106.10"><b>106.10.</b></a> If an effect would add mana represented by a generic mana symbol to a player’s mana pool, that much colorless mana is added to that player’s mana pool.</p>
<p><a id="cr106.11"><b>106.11.</b></a> If an effect would add mana represented by one or more snow mana symbols to a player’s mana pool, that much colorless mana is added to that player’s mana pool.</p>
<p><a id="cr106.12"><b>106.12.</b></a> To “tap [a permanent] for mana” is to activate a mana ability of that permanent that includes the {T} symbol in its activation cost. See rule <a href="#cr605">605</a>, “Mana Abilities.”</p>
<p><a id="cr106.12a"><b>106.12a</b></a> An ability that triggers whenever a permanent “is tapped for mana” or is tapped for mana of a specified type triggers whenever such a mana ability resolves and produces mana or the specified type of mana.</p>
<p><a id="cr106.12b"><b>106.12b</b></a> A replacement effect that applies if a permanent “is tapped for mana” or tapped for mana of a specific type and/or amount modifies the mana production event while such an ability is resolving and producing mana or the specified type and/or amount of mana.</p>
<p><a id="cr106.13"><b>106.13.</b></a> One card (Drain Power) causes one player to lose unspent mana and another to add “the mana lost this way.” (Note that these may be the same player.) This empties the former player’s mana pool and causes the mana emptied this way to be put into the latter player’s mana pool. Which permanents, spells, and/or abilities produced that mana are unchanged, as are any restrictions or additional effects associated with any of that mana.</p>
<p><a id="cr107"><b>107. Numbers and Symbols</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr107.1"><b>107.1.</b></a> The only numbers the Magic game uses are integers.</p>
<p><a id="cr107.1a"><b>107.1a</b></a> You can’t choose a fractional number, deal fractional damage, gain fractional life, and so on. If a spell or ability could generate a fractional number, the spell or ability will tell you whether to round up or down.</p>
<p><a id="cr107.1b"><b>107.1b</b></a> Most of the time, the Magic game uses only positive numbers and zero. You can’t choose a negative number, deal negative damage, gain negative life, and so on. However, it’s possible for a game value, such as a creature’s power, to be less than zero. If a calculation or comparison needs to use a negative value, it does so. If a calculation that would determine the result of an effect yields a negative number, zero is used instead, unless that effect doubles or sets to a specific value a player’s life total or the power and/or toughness of a creature or creature card.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> If a 3/4 creature gets -5/-0, it’s a -2/4 creature. It doesn’t assign damage in combat. Its total power and toughness is 2. Giving it +3/+0 would raise its power to 1.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Viridian Joiner is a 1/2 creature with the ability “{T}: Add an amount of {G} equal to Viridian Joiner’s power.” An effect gives it -2/-0, then its ability is activated. The ability adds no mana to your mana pool.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Chameleon Colossus is a 4/4 creature with the ability “{2}{G}{G}: Chameleon Colossus gets +X/+X until end of turn, where X is its power.” An effect gives it -6/-0, then its ability is activated. It remains a -2/4 creature. It doesn’t become -4/2.</p>
<p><a id="cr107.1c"><b>107.1c</b></a> If a rule or ability instructs a player to choose “any number,” that player may choose any positive number or zero.</p>
<p><a id="cr107.2"><b>107.2.</b></a> If anything needs to use a number that can’t be determined, either as a result or in a calculation, it uses 0 instead.</p>
<p><a id="cr107.3"><b>107.3.</b></a> Many objects use the letter X as a placeholder for a number that needs to be determined. Some objects have abilities that define the value of X; the rest let their controller choose the value of X.</p>
<p><a id="cr107.3a"><b>107.3a</b></a> If a spell or activated ability has a mana cost, alternative cost, additional cost, and/or activation cost with an {X}, [-X], or X in it, and the value of X isn’t defined by the text of that spell or ability, the controller of that spell or ability chooses and announces the value of X as part of casting the spell or activating the ability. (See rule <a href="#cr601">601</a>, “Casting Spells.”) While a spell is on the stack, any X in its mana cost or in any alternative cost or additional cost it has equals the announced value. While an activated ability is on the stack, any X in its activation cost equals the announced value.</p>

This doesn’t apply to effects that only reduce a cost, even if they reduce it to zero. See rule <a href="#cr601">601</a>, “Casting Spells.”</p>
<p><a id="cr107.3c"><b>107.3c</b></a> If a spell or activated ability has an {X}, [-X], or X in its cost and/or its text, and the value of X is defined by the text of that spell or ability, then that’s the value of X while that spell or ability is on the stack. The controller of that spell or ability doesn’t get to choose the value. Note that the value of X may change while that spell or ability is on the stack.</p>
<p><a id="cr107.3d"><b>107.3d</b></a> If a cost associated with a special action, such as a suspend cost or a morph cost, has an {X} or an X in it, the value of X is chosen by the player taking the special action immediately before they pay that cost.</p>
<p><a id="cr107.3e"><b>107.3e</b></a> If a spell or ability refers to the {X} or X in the mana cost, alternative cost, additional cost, or activation cost of another object, any X in that spell or ability’s text uses the value of X chosen or defined for the other object.</p>

Traditional Magic cards are included in players’ decks. Certain formats also use nontraditional Magic cards. Nontraditional Magic cards are not included in players’ decks. They may be used in supplementary decks. Additionally, they may be oversized, have different card backs, or both.</p>
<p><a id="cr108.2b"><b>108.2b</b></a> Tokens aren’t considered cards—even a card-sized game supplement that represents a token isn’t considered a card for rules purposes.</p>
<p><a id="cr108.3"><b>108.3.</b></a> The owner of a card in the game is the player who started the game with it in their deck. If a card is brought into the game from outside the game rather than starting in a player’s deck, its owner is the player who brought it into the game. If a card starts the game in the command zone, its owner is the player who put it into the command zone to start the game. Legal ownership of a card in the game is irrelevant to the game rules except for the rules for ante. (See rule <a href="#cr407.">407.</a>)</p>
<p><a id="cr108.3a"><b>108.3a</b></a> In a Planechase game using the single planar deck option, the planar controller is considered to be the owner of all cards in the planar deck. See rule <a href="#cr901.6">901.6</a>.</p>

If a card outside that game is in the sideboard of a Magic game (see rule <a href="#cr100.4">100.4</a>), its owner is considered to be the player who started the game with it in their sideboard. In all other cases, the owner of a card outside the game is its legal owner.</p>

<p><a id="cr109.2c"><b>109.2c</b></a> If a spell or ability uses a description of an object that includes the word “source,” it means a source matching that description—a source of an ability, of damage, or of mana—in any zone. See rules <a href="#cr113.7">113.7</a> and <a href="#cr609.7">609.7</a>.</p>
<p><a id="cr109.2d"><b>109.2d</b></a> If an ability of a scheme card includes the text “this scheme,” it means the scheme card in the command zone on which that ability is printed.</p>
<p><a id="cr109.3"><b>109.3.</b></a> An object’s characteristics are name, mana cost, color, color indicator, card type, subtype, supertype, rules text, abilities, power, toughness, loyalty, hand modifier, and life modifier. Objects can have some or all of these characteristics. Any other information about an object isn’t a characteristic. For example, characteristics don’t include whether a permanent is tapped, a spell’s target, an object’s owner or controller, what an Aura enchants, and so on.</p>
<p><a id="cr109.4"><b>109.4.</b></a> Only objects on the stack or on the battlefield have a controller. Objects that are neither on the stack nor on the battlefield aren’t controlled by any player. See rule <a href="#cr108.4">108.4</a>. There are six exceptions to this rule:</p>
<p><a id="cr109.4a"><b>109.4a</b></a> The controller of a mana ability is determined as though it were on the stack. See rule <a href="#cr605">605</a>, “Mana Abilities.”</p>
<p><a id="cr109.4b"><b>109.4b</b></a> A triggered ability that has triggered but is waiting to be placed on the stack is controlled by the player who controlled its source at the time it triggered, unless it’s a delayed triggered ability.

<p><a id="cr109.5"><b>109.5.</b></a> The words “you” and “your” on an object refer to the object’s controller, its would-be controller (if a player is attempting to play, cast, or activate it), or its owner (if it has no controller). For a static ability, this is the current controller of the object it’s on. For an activated ability, this is the player who activated the ability. For a triggered ability, this is the controller of the object when the ability triggered, unless it’s a delayed triggered ability.

<p><a id="cr110"><b>110. Permanents</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr110.1"><b>110.1.</b></a> A permanent is a card or token on the battlefield. A permanent remains on the battlefield indefinitely. A card or token becomes a permanent as it enters the battlefield and it stops being a permanent as it’s moved to another zone by an effect or rule.</p>
<p><a id="cr110.2"><b>110.2.</b></a> A permanent’s owner is the same as the owner of the card that represents it (unless it’s a token; see rule <a href="#cr111.2">111.2</a>). A permanent’s controller is, by default, the player under whose control it entered the battlefield. Every permanent has a controller.</p>
<p><a id="cr110.2a"><b>110.2a</b></a> If an effect instructs a player to put an object onto the battlefield, that object enters the battlefield under that player’s control unless the effect states otherwise.</p>
<p><a id="cr110.2b"><b>110.2b</b></a> If an effect causes a player to gain control of another player’s permanent spell, the first player controls the permanent that spell becomes, but the permanent’s controller by default is the player who put that spell onto the stack. (This distinction is relevant in multiplayer games; see rule <a href="#cr800.4c">800.4c</a>.)</p>
<p><a id="cr110.3"><b>110.3.</b></a> A nontoken permanent’s characteristics are the same as those printed on its card, as modified by any continuous effects. See rule <a href="#cr613">613</a>, “Interaction of Continuous Effects.”</p>
<p><a id="cr110.4"><b>110.4.</b></a> There are five permanent types: artifact, creature, enchantment, land, and planeswalker. Instant and sorcery cards can’t enter the battlefield and thus can’t be permanents. Some tribal cards can enter the battlefield and some can’t, depending on their other card types. See <a href="#cr3">section 3</a>, “Card Types.”</p>
<p><a id="cr110.4a"><b>110.4a</b></a> The term “permanent card” is used to refer to a card that could be put onto the battlefield. Specifically, it means an artifact, creature, enchantment, land, or planeswalker card.</p>
<p><a id="cr110.4b"><b>110.4b</b></a> The term “permanent spell” is used to refer to a spell that will enter the battlefield as a permanent as part of its resolution. Specifically, it means an artifact, creature, enchantment, or planeswalker spell.</p>
<p><a id="cr110.4c"><b>110.4c</b></a> If a permanent somehow loses all its permanent types, it remains on the battlefield. It’s still a permanent.</p>
<p><a id="cr110.5"><b>110.5.</b></a> A permanent’s status is its physical state. There are four status categories, each of which has two possible values: tapped/untapped, flipped/unflipped, face up/face down, and phased in/phased out. Each permanent always has one of these values for each of these categories.</p>
<p><a id="cr110.5a"><b>110.5a</b></a> Status is not a characteristic, though it may affect a permanent’s characteristics.</p>
<p><a id="cr110.5b"><b>110.5b</b></a> Permanents enter the battlefield untapped, unflipped, face up, and phased in unless a spell or ability says otherwise.</p>
<p><a id="cr110.5c"><b>110.5c</b></a> A permanent retains its status until a spell, ability, or turn-based action changes it, even if that status is not relevant to it.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Dimir Doppelganger says “{1}{U}{B}: Exile target creature card from a graveyard. Dimir Doppelganger becomes a copy of that card and gains this ability.” It becomes a copy of Jushi Apprentice, a flip card. Through use of Jushi Apprentice’s ability, this creature flips, making it a copy of Tomoya the Revealer with the Dimir Doppelganger ability. If this permanent then becomes a copy of Runeclaw Bear, it will retain its flipped status even though that has no relevance to Runeclaw Bear. If its copy ability is activated again, this time targeting a Nezumi Shortfang card (another flip card), this permanent’s flipped status means it will have the characteristics of Stabwhisker the Odious (the flipped version of Nezumi Shortfang) with the Dimir Doppelganger ability.</p>
<p><a id="cr110.5d"><b>110.5d</b></a> Only permanents have status. Cards not on the battlefield do not. Although an exiled card may be face down, this has no correlation to the face-down status of a permanent. Similarly, cards not on the battlefield are neither tapped nor untapped, regardless of their physical state.</p>
<p><a id="cr111"><b>111. Tokens</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr111.1"><b>111.1.</b></a> Some effects put tokens onto the battlefield. A token is a marker used to represent any permanent that isn’t represented by a card.</p>
<p><a id="cr111.2"><b>111.2.</b></a> The player who creates a token is its owner. The token enters the battlefield under that player’s control.</p>
<p><a id="cr111.3"><b>111.3.</b></a> The spell or ability that creates a token may define the values of any number of characteristics for the token. This becomes the token’s “text.” The characteristic values defined this way are functionally equivalent to the characteristic values that are printed on a card; for example, they define the token’s copiable values. A token doesn’t have any characteristics not defined by the spell or ability that created it.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Jade Mage has the ability “{2}{G}: Create a 1/1 green Saproling creature token.” The resulting token has no mana cost, supertypes, rules text, or abilities.</p>
<p><a id="cr111.4"><b>111.4.</b></a> A spell or ability that creates a token sets both its name and its subtype(s). If the spell or ability doesn’t specify the name of the token, its name is the same as its subtype(s) plus the word “Token.” Once a token is on the battlefield, changing its name doesn’t change its subtype(s), and vice versa.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Dwarven Reinforcements is a sorcery that says, in part, “Create two 2/1 red Dwarf Berserker creature tokens.” The tokens created as it resolves are each named Dwarf Berserker Token and each have the creature types Dwarf and Berserker.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Minsc, Beloved Ranger says, in part, “When Minsc, Beloved Ranger enters the battlefield, create Boo, a legendary 1/1 red Hamster creature token with trample and haste.” That token’s subtype is Hamster, but because Minsc specifies that the token’s name is Boo, neither “Hamster” nor “Token” are part of its name.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Spitting Image is a sorcery that says, in part, “Create a token that’s a copy of target creature.” All of that token’s characteristics will match the copiable characteristics of the creature targeted by that spell. If Spitting Image targets Doomed Dissenter, a Human creature, the name of the token the spell creates will be Doomed Dissenter, not Human Token or Doomed Dissenter Token.</p>
<p><a id="cr111.5"><b>111.5.</b></a> If a spell or ability would create a token, but a rule or effect states that a permanent with one or more of that token’s characteristics can’t enter the battlefield, the token is not created.</p>
<p><a id="cr111.6"><b>111.6.</b></a> A token is subject to anything that affects permanents in general or that affects the token’s card type or subtype. A token isn’t a card (even if represented by a card that has a Magic back or that came from a Magic booster pack).</p>
<p><a id="cr111.7"><b>111.7.</b></a> A token that’s in a zone other than the battlefield ceases to exist. This is a state-based action; see rule <a href="#cr704.">704.</a> (Note that if a token changes zones, applicable triggered abilities will trigger before the token ceases to exist.)</p>
<p><a id="cr111.8"><b>111.8.</b></a> A token that has left the battlefield can’t move to another zone or come back onto the battlefield. If such a token would change zones, it remains in its current zone instead. It ceases to exist the next time state-based actions are checked; see rule <a href="#cr704.">704.</a></p>
<p><a id="cr111.9"><b>111.9.</b></a> Some effects instruct a player to create a legendary token. These may be written “create [name], a . . .” and list characteristics for the token. This is the same as an instruction to create a token with the listed characteristics that has the given name. </p>
<p><a id="cr111.10"><b>111.10.</b></a> Some effects instruct a player to create a predefined token. These effects use the definition below to determine the characteristics the token is created with.

As the first step of being cast (see rule <a href="#cr601">601</a>, “Casting Spells”), the card becomes a spell and is moved to the top of the stack from the zone it was in, which is usually its owner’s hand. (See rule <a href="#cr405">405</a>, “Stack.”) A spell remains on the stack as a spell until it resolves (see rule <a href="#cr608">608</a>, “Resolving Spells and Abilities”), is countered (see rule <a href="#cr701.5">701.5</a>), or otherwise leaves the stack. For more information, see <a href="#cr6">section 6</a>, “Spells, Abilities, and Effects.”</p>
<p><a id="cr112.1a"><b>112.1a</b></a> A copy of a spell is also a spell, even if it has no card associated with it. See rule <a href="#cr707.10">707.10</a>.</p>
<p><a id="cr112.1b"><b>112.1b</b></a> Some effects allow a player to cast a copy of a card; if the player does, that copy is a spell as well. See rule <a href="#cr707.12">707.12</a>.</p>
<p><a id="cr112.2"><b>112.2.</b></a> A spell’s owner is the same as the owner of the card that represents it, unless it’s a copy. In that case, the owner of the spell is the player under whose control it was put on the stack. A spell’s controller is, by default, the player who put it on the stack. Every spell has a controller.</p>
<p><a id="cr112.3"><b>112.3.</b></a> A noncopy spell’s characteristics are the same as those printed on its card, as modified by any continuous effects. See rule <a href="#cr613">613</a>, “Interaction of Continuous Effects.”</p>
<p><a id="cr112.4"><b>112.4.</b></a> If an effect changes any characteristics of a permanent spell, the effect continues to apply to the permanent when the spell resolves. See rule <a href="#cr400.7">400.7</a>.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> If an effect changes a black creature spell to white, the creature is white when it enters the battlefield and remains white for the duration of the effect changing its color.</p>
<p><b>★</b> <a id="cr112.5"><b>112.5.</b></a> A spell "fails to resolve" when it is removed from the stack for any reason other than during the resolution of that spell. See rule <a href="#cr608.2b">608.2b</a>.</p>
<p><a id="cr113"><b>113. Abilities</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr113.1"><b>113.1.</b></a> An ability can be one of three things:</p>
<p><a id="cr113.1a"><b>113.1a</b></a> An ability can be a characteristic an object has that lets it affect the game. An object’s abilities are defined by its rules text or by the effect that created it. Abilities can also be granted to objects by rules or effects. (Effects that grant abilities usually use the words “has,” “have,” “gains,” or “gain.”) Abilities generate effects. (See rule <a href="#cr609">609</a>, “Effects.”)</p>
<p><a id="cr113.1b"><b>113.1b</b></a> An ability can be something that a player has that changes how the game affects the player. A player normally has no abilities unless granted to that player by effects.</p>
<p><a id="cr113.1c"><b>113.1c</b></a> An ability can be an activated or triggered ability on the stack. This kind of ability is an object. (See <a href="#cr6">section 6</a>, “Spells, Abilities, and Effects.”)</p>
<p><a id="cr113.2"><b>113.2.</b></a> Abilities can affect the objects they’re on. They can also affect other objects and/or players.</p>
<p><a id="cr113.2a"><b>113.2a</b></a> Abilities can be beneficial or detrimental.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> “[This creature] can’t block” is an ability.</p>
<p><a id="cr113.2b"><b>113.2b</b></a> An additional cost or alternative cost to cast a card is an ability of the card.</p>
<p><a id="cr113.2c"><b>113.2c</b></a> An object may have multiple abilities. If the object is represented by a card, then aside from certain defined abilities that may be strung together on a single line (see rule <a href="#cr702">702</a>, “Keyword Abilities”), each paragraph break in a card’s text marks a separate ability. If the object is not represented by a card, the effect that created it may have given it multiple abilities. An object may also be granted additional abilities by a spell or ability. If an object has multiple instances of the same ability, each instance functions independently. This may or may not produce more effects than a single instance; refer to the specific ability for more information.</p>
<p><a id="cr113.2d"><b>113.2d</b></a> Abilities can generate one-shot effects or continuous effects. Some continuous effects are replacement effects or prevention effects. See rule <a href="#cr609">609</a>, “Effects.”</p>
<p><a id="cr113.3"><b>113.3.</b></a> There are four general categories of abilities:</p>
<p><a id="cr113.3a"><b>113.3a</b></a> Spell abilities are abilities that are followed as instructions while an instant or sorcery spell is resolving. Any text on an instant or sorcery spell is a spell ability unless it’s an activated ability, a triggered ability, or a static ability that fits the criteria described in rule <a href="#cr113.6">113.6</a>.</p>
<p><a id="cr113.3b"><b>113.3b</b></a> Activated abilities have a cost and an effect. They are written as “[Cost]: [Effect.] [Activation instructions (if any).]” A player may activate such an ability whenever they have priority. Doing so puts it on the stack, where it remains until it’s countered, it resolves, or it otherwise leaves the stack. See rule <a href="#cr602">602</a>, “Activating Activated Abilities.”</p>
<p><a id="cr113.3c"><b>113.3c</b></a> Triggered abilities have a trigger condition and an effect. They are written as “[Trigger condition], [effect],” and include (and usually begin with) the word “when,” “whenever,” or “at.” Whenever the trigger event occurs, the ability is put on the stack the next time a player would receive priority and stays there until it’s countered, it resolves, or it otherwise leaves the stack. See rule <a href="#cr603">603</a>, “Handling Triggered Abilities.”</p>
<p><a id="cr113.3d"><b>113.3d</b></a> Static abilities are written as statements. They’re simply true. Static abilities create continuous effects which are active while the permanent with the ability is on the battlefield and has the ability, or while the object with the ability is in the appropriate zone. See rule <a href="#cr604">604</a>, “Handling Static Abilities.”</p>
<p><a id="cr113.4"><b>113.4.</b></a> Some activated abilities and some triggered abilities are mana abilities. Mana abilities follow special rules: They don’t use the stack, and, under certain circumstances, a player can activate mana abilities even if they don’t have priority. See rule <a href="#cr605">605</a>, “Mana Abilities.”</p>
<p><a id="cr113.5"><b>113.5.</b></a> Some activated abilities are loyalty abilities. Loyalty abilities follow special rules: A player may activate a loyalty ability of a permanent they control any time they have priority and the stack is empty during a main phase of their turn, but only if no player has previously activated a loyalty ability of that permanent that turn. See rule <a href="#cr606">606</a>, “Loyalty Abilities.”</p>
<p><a id="cr113.6"><b>113.6.</b></a> Abilities of an instant or sorcery spell usually function only while that object is on the stack. Abilities of all other objects usually function only while that object is on the battlefield. The exceptions are as follows:</p>
<p><a id="cr113.6a"><b>113.6a</b></a> Characteristic-defining abilities function everywhere, even outside the game and before the game begins. (See rule <a href="#cr604.3">604.3</a>.)</p>
<p><a id="cr113.6b"><b>113.6b</b></a> An ability that states which zones it functions in functions only from those zones.</p>
<p><a id="cr113.6c"><b>113.6c</b></a> An ability that states which zones it doesn’t function in functions everywhere except for the specified zones, even outside the game and before the game begins.</p>
<p><a id="cr113.6d"><b>113.6d</b></a> An object’s ability that allows a player to pay an alternative cost rather than its mana cost or otherwise modifies what that particular object costs to cast functions on the stack.</p>
<p><a id="cr113.6e"><b>113.6e</b></a> An object’s ability that restricts or modifies how that particular object can be played or cast functions in any zone from which it could be played or cast and also on the stack. An object’s ability that grants it another ability that restricts or modifies how that particular object can be played or cast functions only on the stack.</p>
<p><a id="cr113.6f"><b>113.6f</b></a> An object’s ability that restricts or modifies what zones that particular object can be played or cast from functions everywhere, even outside the game.</p>
<p><a id="cr113.6g"><b>113.6g</b></a> An object’s ability that states it can’t be countered functions on the stack.</p>
<p><a id="cr113.6h"><b>113.6h</b></a> An object’s ability that modifies how that particular object enters the battlefield functions as that object is entering the battlefield. See rule <a href="#cr614.12">614.12</a>.</p>
<p><a id="cr113.6i"><b>113.6i</b></a> An object’s ability that states counters can’t be put on that object functions as that object is entering the battlefield in addition to functioning while that object is on the battlefield.</p>
<p><a id="cr113.6j"><b>113.6j</b></a> An object’s activated ability that has a cost that can’t be paid while the object is on the battlefield functions from any zone in which its cost can be paid.</p>
<p><a id="cr113.6k"><b>113.6k</b></a> A trigger condition that can’t trigger from the battlefield functions in all zones it can trigger from. Other trigger conditions of the same triggered ability may function in different zones.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Absolver Thrull has the ability “When Absolver Thrull enters the battlefield or the creature it haunts dies, destroy target enchantment.” The first trigger condition functions from the battlefield and the second trigger condition functions from the exile zone. (See rule <a href="#cr702.55">702.55</a>, “Haunt.”)</p>
<p><a id="cr113.6m"><b>113.6m</b></a> An ability whose cost or effect specifies that it moves the object it’s on out of a particular zone functions only in that zone, unless its trigger condition or a previous part of its cost or effect specifies that the object is put into that zone or, if the object is an Aura, that the object it enchants leaves the battlefield. The same is true if the effect of that ability creates a delayed triggered ability whose effect moves the object out of a particular zone.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Reassembling Skeleton says “{1}{B}: Return Reassembling Skeleton from your graveyard to the battlefield tapped.” A player may activate this ability only if Reassembling Skeleton is in their graveyard.</p>
<p><a id="cr113.6n"><b>113.6n</b></a> An ability that modifies the rules for deck construction functions before the game begins. Such an ability modifies not just the Comprehensive Rules, but also the Magic: The Gathering Tournament Rules and any other documents that set the deck construction rules for a specific format. However, such an ability can’t affect the format legality of a card, including whether it’s banned or restricted. The current Magic: The Gathering Tournament Rules can be found at WPN.Wizards.com/en/resources/rules-documents.</p>
<p><a id="cr113.6p"><b>113.6p</b></a> Abilities of emblems, plane cards, vanguard cards, scheme cards, and conspiracy cards function in the command zone. See rule <a href="#cr114">114</a>, “Emblems”; rule <a href="#cr901">901</a>, “Planechase”; rule <a href="#cr902">902</a>, “Vanguard”; rule <a href="#cr904">904</a>, “Archenemy”; and rule <a href="#cr905">905</a>, “Conspiracy Draft.”</p>
<p><a id="cr113.7"><b>113.7.</b></a> The source of an ability is the object that generated it. The source of an activated ability on the stack is the object whose ability was activated. The source of a triggered ability (other than a delayed triggered ability) on the stack, or one that has triggered and is waiting to be put on the stack, is the object whose ability triggered. To determine the source of a delayed triggered ability, see rules <a href="#cr603.7d">603.7d</a>–f.</p>
<p><a id="cr113.7a"><b>113.7a</b></a> Once activated or triggered, an ability exists on the stack independently of its source. Destruction or removal of the source after that time won’t affect the ability. Note that some abilities cause a source to do something (for example, “Prodigal Pyromancer deals 1 damage to any target”) rather than the ability doing anything directly. In these cases, any activated or triggered ability that references information about the source for use while announcing an activated ability or putting a triggered ability on the stack checks that information when the ability is put onto the stack. Otherwise, it will check that information when it resolves. In both instances, if the source is no longer in the zone it’s expected to be in at that time, its last known information is used. The source can still perform the action even though it no longer exists.</p>
<p><a id="cr113.8"><b>113.8.</b></a> The controller of an activated ability on the stack is the player who activated it. The controller of a triggered ability on the stack (other than a delayed triggered ability) is the player who controlled the ability’s source when it triggered, or, if it had no controller, the player who owned the ability’s source when it triggered. To determine the controller of a delayed triggered ability, see rules <a href="#cr603.7d">603.7d</a>–f.</p>
<p><a id="cr113.9"><b>113.9.</b></a> Activated and triggered abilities on the stack aren’t spells, and therefore can’t be countered by anything that counters only spells. Activated and triggered abilities on the stack can be countered by effects that specifically counter abilities. Static abilities don’t use the stack and thus can’t be countered at all.</p>
<p><a id="cr113.10"><b>113.10.</b></a> Effects can add or remove abilities of objects. An effect that adds an ability will state that the object “gains” or “has” that ability, or similar. An effect that removes an ability will state that the object “loses” that ability.</p>
<p><a id="cr113.10a"><b>113.10a</b></a> An effect that adds an activated ability may include activation instructions for that ability. These instructions become part of the ability that’s added to the object.</p>
<p><a id="cr113.10b"><b>113.10b</b></a> Effects that remove an ability remove all instances of it.</p>
<p><a id="cr113.10c"><b>113.10c</b></a> If two or more effects add and remove the same ability, in general the most recent one prevails. See rule <a href="#cr613">613</a> for more information about the interaction of continuous effects.</p>
<p><a id="cr113.11"><b>113.11.</b></a> Effects can stop an object from having a specified ability. These effects say that the object “can’t have” that ability. If the object has that ability, it loses it. It’s also impossible for an effect or keyword counter to add that ability to the object. If a resolving spell or ability creates a continuous effect that would add the specified ability to such an object, that part of that continuous effect does not apply; however, other parts of that continuous effect will still apply, and that resolving spell or ability can still create other continuous effects. Continuous effects created by static abilities that would add the specified ability won’t apply to that object.</p>
<p><a id="cr113.12"><b>113.12.</b></a> An effect that sets an object’s characteristic, or simply states a quality of that object, is different from an ability granted by an effect. When an object “gains” or “has” an ability, that ability can be removed by another effect. If an effect defines a characteristic of the object (“[permanent] is [characteristic value]”), it’s not granting an ability. (See rule <a href="#cr604.3">604.3</a>.) Similarly, if an effect states a quality of that object (“[creature] can’t be blocked,” for example), it’s neither granting an ability nor setting a characteristic.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Muraganda Petroglyphs reads, “Creatures with no abilities get +2/+2.” A Runeclaw Bear (a creature with no abilities) enchanted by an Aura that says “Enchanted creature has flying” would not get +2/+2. A Runeclaw Bear enchanted by an Aura that says “Enchanted creature is red” or “Enchanted creature can’t be blocked” would get +2/+2.</p>
<p><a id="cr114"><b>114. Emblems</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr114.1"><b>114.1.</b></a> Some effects put emblems into the command zone. An emblem is a marker used to represent an object that has one or more abilities, but no other characteristics.</p>
<p><a id="cr114.2"><b>114.2.</b></a> An effect that creates an emblem is written “[Player] gets an emblem with [ability].” This means that [player] puts an emblem with [ability] into the command zone. The emblem is both owned and controlled by that player.</p>
<p><a id="cr114.3"><b>114.3.</b></a> An emblem has no characteristics other than the abilities defined by the effect that created it. In particular, an emblem has no name, no types, no mana cost, and no color.</p>
<p><a id="cr114.4"><b>114.4.</b></a> Abilities of emblems function in the command zone.</p>
<p><a id="cr114.5"><b>114.5.</b></a> An emblem is neither a card nor a permanent. Emblem isn’t a card type.</p>
<p><a id="cr115"><b>115. Targets</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr115.1"><b>115.1.</b></a> Some spells and abilities require their controller to choose one or more targets for them. The targets are object(s) and/or player(s) the spell or ability will affect. These targets are declared as part of the process of putting the spell or ability on the stack. The targets can’t be changed except by another spell or ability that explicitly says it can do so.</p>
<p><a id="cr115.1a"><b>115.1a</b></a> An instant or sorcery spell is targeted if its spell ability identifies something it will affect by using the phrase “target [something],” where the “something” is a phrase that describes an object and/or player. The target(s) are chosen as the spell is cast; see rule <a href="#cr601.2c">601.2c</a>. (If an activated or triggered ability of an instant or sorcery uses the word target, that ability is targeted, but the spell is not.)<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> A sorcery card has the ability “When you cycle this card, target creature gets -1/-1 until end of turn.” This triggered ability is targeted, but that doesn’t make the card it’s on targeted.</p>
<p><a id="cr115.1b"><b>115.1b</b></a> Aura spells are always targeted. An Aura’s target is specified by its enchant keyword ability (see rule <a href="#cr702.5">702.5</a>, “Enchant”). The target is chosen as the spell is cast; see rule <a href="#cr601.2c">601.2c</a>. An Aura permanent doesn’t target anything; only the spell is targeted. (An activated or triggered ability of an Aura permanent can also be targeted.)</p>
<p><a id="cr115.1c"><b>115.1c</b></a> An activated ability is targeted if it identifies something it will affect by using the phrase “target [something],” where the “something” is a phrase that describes an object and/or player. The target(s) are chosen as the ability is activated; see rule <a href="#cr602.2b">602.2b</a>.</p>
<p><a id="cr115.1d"><b>115.1d</b></a> A triggered ability is targeted if it identifies something it will affect by using the phrase “target [something],” where the “something” is a phrase that describes an object and/or player. The target(s) are chosen as the ability is put on the stack; see rule <a href="#cr603.3d">603.3d</a>.</p>
<p><a id="cr115.1e"><b>115.1e</b></a> Some keyword abilities, such as equip and modular, represent targeted activated or triggered abilities, and some keyword abilities, such as mutate, cause spells to have targets. In those cases, the phrase “target [something]” appears in the rule for that keyword ability rather than in the ability itself. (The keyword’s reminder text will often contain the word “target.”) See rule <a href="#cr702">702</a>, “Keyword Abilities.”</p>
<p><a id="cr115.2"><b>115.2.</b></a> Only permanents are legal targets for spells and abilities, unless a spell or ability (a) specifies that it can target an object in another zone or a player, or (b) targets an object that can’t exist on the battlefield, such as a spell or ability. See also rule <a href="#cr115.4">115.4</a>.</p>
<p><a id="cr115.3"><b>115.3.</b></a> The same target can’t be chosen multiple times for any one instance of the word “target” on a spell or ability. If the spell or ability uses the word “target” in multiple places, the same object or player can be chosen once for each instance of the word “target” (as long as it fits the targeting criteria). This rule applies both when choosing targets for a spell or ability and when changing targets or choosing new targets for a spell or ability (see rule <a href="#cr115.7">115.7</a>).</p>
<p><a id="cr115.4"><b>115.4.</b></a> Some spells and abilities that refer to damage require “any target,” “another target,” “two targets,” or similar rather than “target [something].” These targets may be creatures, players, or planeswalkers. Other game objects, such as noncreature artifacts or spells, can’t be chosen.</p>
<p><a id="cr115.5"><b>115.5.</b></a> A spell or ability on the stack is an illegal target for itself.</p>
<p><a id="cr115.6"><b>115.6.</b></a> A spell or ability that requires targets may allow zero targets to be chosen. Such a spell or ability is still said to require targets, but that spell or ability is targeted only if one or more targets have been chosen for it.</p>
<p><a id="cr115.7"><b>115.7.</b></a> Some effects allow a player to change the target(s) of a spell or ability, and other effects allow a player to choose new targets for a spell or ability.</p>
<p><a id="cr115.7a"><b>115.7a</b></a> If an effect allows a player to “change the target(s)” of a spell or ability, each target can be changed only to another legal target. If a target can’t be changed to another legal target, the original target is unchanged, even if the original target is itself illegal by then. If all the targets aren’t changed to other legal targets, none of them are changed.</p>
<p><a id="cr115.7b"><b>115.7b</b></a> If an effect allows a player to “change a target” of a spell or ability, the process described in rule <a href="#cr115.7a">115.7a</a> is followed, except that only one of those targets may be changed (rather than all of them or none of them).</p>
<p><a id="cr115.7c"><b>115.7c</b></a> If an effect allows a player to “change any targets” of a spell or ability, the process described in rule <a href="#cr115.7a">115.7a</a> is followed, except that any number of those targets may be changed (rather than all of them or none of them).</p>
<p><a id="cr115.7d"><b>115.7d</b></a> If an effect allows a player to “choose new targets” for a spell or ability, the player may leave any number of the targets unchanged, even if those targets would be illegal. If the player chooses to change some or all of the targets, the new targets must be legal and must not cause any unchanged targets to become illegal.</p>
<p><a id="cr115.7e"><b>115.7e</b></a> When changing targets or choosing new targets for a spell or ability, only the final set of targets is evaluated to determine whether the change is legal.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Arc Trail is a sorcery that reads “Arc Trail deals 2 damage to any target and 1 damage to another target.” The current targets of Arc Trail are Runeclaw Bear and Llanowar Elves, in that order. You cast Redirect, an instant that reads “You may choose new targets for target spell,” targeting Arc Trail. You can change the first target to Llanowar Elves and change the second target to Runeclaw Bear.</p>
<p><a id="cr115.7f"><b>115.7f</b></a> A spell or ability may “divide” or “distribute” an effect (such as damage or counters) among one or more targets. When changing targets or choosing new targets for that spell or ability, the original division can’t be changed.</p>
<p><a id="cr115.8"><b>115.8.</b></a> Modal spells and abilities may have different targeting requirements for each mode. An effect that allows a player to change the target(s) of a modal spell or ability, or to choose new targets for a modal spell or ability, doesn’t allow that player to change its mode. (See rule <a href="#cr700.2">700.2</a>.)</p>
<p><a id="cr115.9"><b>115.9.</b></a> Some objects check what another spell or ability is targeting. Depending on the wording, these may check the current state of the targets, the state of the targets at the time they were selected, or both.</p>
<p><a id="cr115.9a"><b>115.9a</b></a> An object that looks for a “[spell or ability] with a single target” checks the number of times any object or player was chosen as the target of that spell or ability when it was put on the stack, not the number of its targets that are currently legal. If the same object or player became a target more than once, each of those instances is counted separately.</p>
<p><a id="cr115.9b"><b>115.9b</b></a> An object that looks for a “[spell or ability] that targets [something]” checks the current state of that spell or ability’s targets. If an object it targets is still in the zone it’s expected to be in or a player it targets is still in the game, that target’s current information is used, even if it’s not currently legal for that spell or ability. If an object it targets is no longer in the zone it’s expected to be in or a player it targets is no longer in the game, that target is ignored; its last known information is not used.</p>
<p><a id="cr115.9c"><b>115.9c</b></a> An object that looks for a “[spell or ability] that targets only [something]” checks the number of different objects or players that were chosen as targets of that spell or ability when it was put on the stack (as modified by effects that changed those targets), not the number of those objects or players that are currently legal targets. If that number is one (even if the spell or ability targets that object or player multiple times), the current state of that spell or ability’s target is checked as described in rule <a href="#cr115.9b">115.9b</a>.</p>
<p><a id="cr115.10"><b>115.10.</b></a> Spells and abilities can affect objects and players they don’t target. In general, those objects and players aren’t chosen until the spell or ability resolves. See rule <a href="#cr608">608</a>, “Resolving Spells and Abilities.”</p>
<p><a id="cr115.10a"><b>115.10a</b></a> Just because an object or player is being affected by a spell or ability doesn’t make that object or player a target of that spell or ability. Unless that object or player is identified by the word “target” in the text of that spell or ability, or the rule for that keyword ability, it’s not a target.</p>
<p><a id="cr115.10b"><b>115.10b</b></a> In particular, the word “you” in an object’s text doesn’t indicate a target.</p>
<p><a id="cr116"><b>116. Special Actions</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr116.1"><b>116.1.</b></a> Special actions are actions a player may take when they have priority that don’t use the stack. These are not to be confused with turn-based actions and state-based actions, which the game generates automatically.

<p><a id="cr116.2"><b>116.2.</b></a> There are ten special actions:</p>
<p><a id="cr116.2a"><b>116.2a</b></a> Playing a land is a special action. To play a land, a player puts that land onto the battlefield from the zone it was in (usually that player’s hand). By default, a player can take this action only once during each of their turns. A player can take this action any time they have priority and the stack is empty during a main phase of their turn. See rule <a href="#cr305">305</a>, “Lands.”</p>
<p><a id="cr116.2b"><b>116.2b</b></a> Turning a face-down creature face up is a special action. A player can take this action any time they have priority. See rule <a href="#cr708">708</a>, “Face-Down Spells and Permanents.”</p>
<p><a id="cr116.2c"><b>116.2c</b></a> Some effects allow a player to take an action at a later time, usually to end a continuous effect or to stop a delayed triggered ability from triggering. Doing so is a special action. A player can take such an action any time they have priority, unless that effect specifies another timing restriction, for as long as the effect allows it.</p>
<p><a id="cr116.2d"><b>116.2d</b></a> Some effects from static abilities allow a player to take an action to ignore the effect from that ability for a duration. Doing so is a special action. A player can take such an action any time they have priority.</p>
<p><a id="cr116.2e"><b>116.2e</b></a> One card (Circling Vultures) has the ability “You may discard Circling Vultures any time you could cast an instant.” Doing so is a special action. A player can take such an action any time they have priority.</p>
<p><a id="cr116.2f"><b>116.2f</b></a> A player who has a card with suspend in their hand may exile that card. This is a special action. A player can take this action any time they have priority, but only if they could begin to cast that card by putting it onto the stack. See rule <a href="#cr702.62">702.62</a>, “Suspend.”</p>
<p><a id="cr116.2g"><b>116.2g</b></a> A player who has chosen a companion may pay {3} to put that card from outside the game into their hand. This is a special action. A player can take this action any time they have priority and the stack is empty during a main phase of their turn, but only if they haven’t done so yet this game. (See rule <a href="#cr702.139">702.139</a>, “Companion.”)</p>
<p><a id="cr116.2h"><b>116.2h</b></a> A player who has a card with foretell in their hand may pay {2} and exile that card face down. This is a special action. A player may take this action any time they have priority during their turn. See rule <a href="#cr702.143">702.143</a>, “Foretell.”</p>
<p><a id="cr116.2i"><b>116.2i</b></a> In a Planechase game, rolling the planar die is a special action. A player can take this action any time they have priority and the stack is empty during a main phase of their turn. Taking this action costs a player an amount of mana equal to the number of times they have previously taken this action on that turn. Note that this number won’t be equal to the number of times the player has rolled the planar die that turn if an effect has caused the player to roll the planar die that turn. See rule <a href="#cr901">901</a>, “Planechase.”</p>
<p><a id="cr116.2j"><b>116.2j</b></a> In a Conspiracy Draft game, turning a face-down conspiracy card in the command zone face up is a special action. A player can take this action any time they have priority. See rule <a href="#cr905.4a">905.4a</a>.</p>
<p><a id="cr116.3"><b>116.3.</b></a> If a player takes a special action, that player receives priority afterward.</p>
<p><a id="cr117"><b>117. Timing and Priority</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr117.1"><b>117.1.</b></a> Unless a spell or ability is instructing a player to take an action, which player can take actions at any given time is determined by a system of priority. The player with priority may cast spells, activate abilities, and take special actions.</p>
<p><a id="cr117.1a"><b>117.1a</b></a> A player may cast an instant spell any time they have priority. A player may cast a noninstant spell during their main phase any time they have priority and the stack is empty.</p>
<p><a id="cr117.1b"><b>117.1b</b></a> A player may activate an activated ability any time they have priority.</p>
<p><a id="cr117.1c"><b>117.1c</b></a> A player may take some special actions any time they have priority. A player may take other special actions during their main phase any time they have priority and the stack is empty. See rule <a href="#cr116">116</a>, “Special Actions.”</p>
<p><a id="cr117.1d"><b>117.1d</b></a> A player may activate a mana ability whenever they have priority, whenever they are casting a spell or activating an ability that requires a mana payment, or whenever a rule or effect asks for a mana payment (even in the middle of casting or resolving a spell or activating or resolving an ability).</p>
<p><a id="cr117.2"><b>117.2.</b></a> Other kinds of abilities and actions are automatically generated or performed by the game rules, or are performed by players without receiving priority.</p>
<p><a id="cr117.2a"><b>117.2a</b></a> Triggered abilities can trigger at any time, including while a spell is being cast, an ability is being activated, or a spell or ability is resolving. (See rule <a href="#cr603">603</a>, “Handling Triggered Abilities.”) However, nothing actually happens at the time an ability triggers. Each time a player would receive priority, each ability that has triggered but hasn’t yet been put on the stack is put on the stack. See rule <a href="#cr117.5">117.5</a>.</p>
<p><a id="cr117.2b"><b>117.2b</b></a> Static abilities continuously affect the game. Priority doesn’t apply to them. (See rule <a href="#cr604">604</a>, “Handling Static Abilities,” and rule <a href="#cr611">611</a>, “Continuous Effects.”)</p>
<p><a id="cr117.2c"><b>117.2c</b></a> Turn-based actions happen automatically when certain steps or phases begin. They’re dealt with before a player would receive priority. See rule <a href="#cr117.3a">117.3a</a>. Turn-based actions also happen automatically when each step and phase ends; no player receives priority afterward. See rule <a href="#cr703">703</a>, “Turn-Based Actions.”</p>
<p><a id="cr117.2d"><b>117.2d</b></a> State-based actions happen automatically when certain conditions are met. See rule <a href="#cr704.">704.</a> They’re dealt with before a player would receive priority. See rule <a href="#cr117.5">117.5</a>.</p>
<p><a id="cr117.2e"><b>117.2e</b></a> Resolving spells and abilities may instruct players to make choices or take actions, or may allow players to activate mana abilities. Even if a player is doing so, no player has priority while a spell or ability is resolving. See rule <a href="#cr608">608</a>, “Resolving Spells and Abilities.”</p>
<p><a id="cr117.3"><b>117.3.</b></a> Which player has priority is determined by the following rules:</p>
<p><a id="cr117.3a"><b>117.3a</b></a> The active player receives priority at the beginning of most steps and phases, after any turn-based actions (such as drawing a card during the draw step; see rule <a href="#cr703">703</a>) have been dealt with and abilities that trigger at the beginning of that phase or step have been put on the stack. No player receives priority during the untap step. Players usually don’t get priority during the cleanup step (see rule <a href="#cr514.3">514.3</a>).</p>
<p><a id="cr117.3b"><b>117.3b</b></a> The active player receives priority after a spell or ability (other than a mana ability) resolves.</p>
<p><a id="cr117.3c"><b>117.3c</b></a> If a player has priority when they cast a spell, activate an ability, or take a special action, that player receives priority afterward.</p>
<p><a id="cr117.3d"><b>117.3d</b></a> If a player has priority and chooses not to take any actions, that player passes. If any mana is in that player’s mana pool, they announce what mana is there. Then the next player in turn order receives priority.</p>
<p><a id="cr117.4"><b>117.4.</b></a> If all players pass in succession (that is, if all players pass without taking any actions in between passing), the spell or ability on top of the stack resolves or, if the stack is empty, the phase or step ends.</p>
<p><a id="cr117.5"><b>117.5.</b></a> Each time a player would get priority, the game first performs all applicable state-based actions as a single event (see rule <a href="#cr704">704</a>, “State-Based Actions”), then repeats this process until no state-based actions are performed. Then triggered abilities are put on the stack (see rule <a href="#cr603">603</a>, “Handling Triggered Abilities”). These steps repeat in order until no further state-based actions are performed and no abilities trigger. Then the player who would have received priority does so.</p>
<p><a id="cr117.6"><b>117.6.</b></a> In a multiplayer game using the shared team turns option, teams rather than individual players have priority. See rule <a href="#cr805">805</a>, “Shared Team Turns Option.”</p>
<p><a id="cr117.7"><b>117.7.</b></a> If a player with priority casts a spell or activates an activated ability while another spell or ability is already on the stack, the new spell or ability has been cast or activated “in response to” the earlier spell or ability. The new spell or ability will resolve first. See rule <a href="#cr608">608</a>, “Resolving Spells and Abilities.”</p>
<p><a id="cr118"><b>118. Costs</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr118.1"><b>118.1.</b></a> A cost is an action or payment necessary to take another action or to stop another action from taking place. To pay a cost, a player carries out the instructions specified by the spell, ability, or effect that contains that cost.</p>
<p><a id="cr118.2"><b>118.2.</b></a> If a cost includes a mana payment, the player paying the cost has a chance to activate mana abilities. Paying the cost to cast a spell or activate an activated ability follows the steps in rules <a href="#cr601.2f">601.2f</a>–h.</p>
<p><a id="cr118.3"><b>118.3.</b></a> A player can’t pay a cost without having the necessary resources to pay it fully. For example, a player with only 1 life can’t pay a cost of 2 life, and a permanent that’s already tapped can’t be tapped to pay a cost. See rule <a href="#cr202">202</a>, “Mana Cost and Color,” and rule <a href="#cr602">602</a>, “Activating Activated Abilities.”</p>
<p><a id="cr118.3a"><b>118.3a</b></a> Paying mana is done by removing the indicated mana from a player’s mana pool. (Players can always pay 0 mana.) If excess mana remains in that player’s mana pool after making that payment, the player announces what mana is still there.</p>
<p><a id="cr118.3b"><b>118.3b</b></a> Paying life is done by subtracting the indicated amount of life from a player’s life total. (Players can always pay 0 life.)</p>
<p><a id="cr118.3c"><b>118.3c</b></a> Activating mana abilities is not mandatory, even if paying a cost is.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> A player controls Lodestone Golem, which says “Nonartifact spells cost {1} more to cast.” Another player removes the last time counter from a suspended sorcery card. That player must cast that spell if able, but doing so costs {1}. The player is forced to pay that cost if enough mana is in their mana pool, but the player isn’t forced to activate a mana ability to produce that mana. If they don’t, the card simply remains exiled.</p>
<p><a id="cr118.4"><b>118.4.</b></a> Some costs include an {X} or an X. See rule <a href="#cr107.3">107.3</a>.</p>
<p><a id="cr118.5"><b>118.5.</b></a> Some costs are represented by {0}, or are reduced to {0}. The action necessary for a player to pay such a cost is the player’s acknowledgment that they are paying it. Even though such a cost requires no resources, it’s not automatically paid.</p>
<p><a id="cr118.5a"><b>118.5a</b></a> A spell whose mana cost is {0} must still be cast the same way as one with a cost greater than zero; it won’t cast itself automatically. The same is true for an activated ability whose cost is {0}.</p>
<p><a id="cr118.6"><b>118.6.</b></a> Some objects have no mana cost. This represents an unpayable cost. An ability can also have an unpayable cost if its cost is based on the mana cost of an object with no mana cost. Attempting to cast a spell or activate an ability that has an unpayable cost is a legal action. However, attempting to pay an unpayable cost is an illegal action.</p>
<p><a id="cr118.6a"><b>118.6a</b></a> If an unpayable cost is increased by an effect or an additional cost is imposed, the cost is still unpayable. If an alternative cost is applied to an unpayable cost, including an effect that allows a player to cast a spell without paying its mana cost, the alternative cost may be paid.</p>
<p><a id="cr118.7"><b>118.7.</b></a> What a player actually needs to do to pay a cost may be changed or reduced by effects. If the mana component of a cost is reduced to nothing by cost reduction effects, it’s considered to be {0}. Paying a cost changed or reduced by an effect counts as paying the original cost.</p>
<p><a id="cr118.7a"><b>118.7a</b></a> Effects that reduce a cost by an amount of generic mana affect only the generic mana component of that cost. They can’t affect the colored or colorless mana components of that cost.</p>
<p><a id="cr118.7b"><b>118.7b</b></a> If a cost is reduced by an amount of colored or colorless mana, but the cost doesn’t require mana of that type, the cost is reduced by that amount of generic mana.</p>
<p><a id="cr118.7c"><b>118.7c</b></a> If a cost is reduced by an amount of colored mana that exceeds its mana component of that color, the cost’s mana component of that color is reduced to nothing and the cost’s generic mana component is reduced by the difference.</p>
<p><a id="cr118.7d"><b>118.7d</b></a> If a cost is reduced by an amount of colorless mana that exceeds its colorless mana component, the cost’s colorless mana component is reduced to nothing and the cost’s generic mana component is reduced by the difference.</p>
<p><a id="cr118.7e"><b>118.7e</b></a> If a cost is reduced by an amount of mana represented by a hybrid mana symbol, the player paying that cost chooses one half of that symbol at the time the cost reduction is applied (see rule <a href="#cr601.2f">601.2f</a>). If a colored half is chosen, the cost is reduced by one mana of that color. If a generic half is chosen, the cost is reduced by an amount of generic mana equal to that half’s number.</p>
<p><a id="cr118.7f"><b>118.7f</b></a> If a cost is reduced by an amount of mana represented by a Phyrexian mana symbol, the cost is reduced by one mana of that symbol’s color.</p>
<p><a id="cr118.7g"><b>118.7g</b></a> If a cost is reduced by an amount of mana represented by one or more snow mana symbols, the cost is reduced by that much generic mana.</p>
<p><a id="cr118.8"><b>118.8.</b></a> Some spells and abilities have additional costs. An additional cost is a cost listed in a spell’s rules text, or applied to a spell or ability from another effect, that its controller must pay at the same time they pay the spell’s mana cost or the ability’s activation cost. Note that some additional costs are listed in keywords; see rule <a href="#cr702.">702.</a></p>
<p><a id="cr118.8a"><b>118.8a</b></a> Any number of additional costs may be applied to a spell as it’s being cast or to an ability as it’s being activated. The controller of the spell or ability announces their intentions to pay any or all of those costs as described in rule <a href="#cr601.2b">601.2b</a>.</p>
<p><a id="cr118.8b"><b>118.8b</b></a> Some additional costs are optional.</p>
<p><a id="cr118.8c"><b>118.8c</b></a> If an effect instructs a player to cast a spell “if able,” and that spell has a mandatory additional cost that includes actions involving cards with a stated quality in a hidden zone, the player isn’t required to cast that spell, even if those cards are present in that zone.</p>
<p><a id="cr118.8d"><b>118.8d</b></a> Additional costs don’t change a spell’s mana cost, only what its controller has to pay to cast it. Spells and abilities that ask for that spell’s mana cost still see the original value.</p>
<p><a id="cr118.9"><b>118.9.</b></a> Some spells have alternative costs. An alternative cost is a cost listed in a spell’s text, or applied to it from another effect, that its controller may pay rather than paying the spell’s mana cost. Alternative costs are usually phrased, “You may [action] rather than pay [this object’s] mana cost,” or “You may cast [this object] without paying its mana cost.” Note that some alternative costs are listed in keywords; see rule <a href="#cr702.">702.</a></p>
<p><a id="cr118.9a"><b>118.9a</b></a> Only one alternative cost can be applied to any one spell as it’s being cast. The controller of the spell announces their intentions to pay that cost as described in rule <a href="#cr601.2b">601.2b</a>.</p>
<p><a id="cr118.9b"><b>118.9b</b></a> Alternative costs are generally optional. An effect that allows you to cast a spell may require a certain alternative cost to be paid.</p>
<p><a id="cr118.9c"><b>118.9c</b></a> An alternative cost doesn’t change a spell’s mana cost, only what its controller has to pay to cast it. Spells and abilities that ask for that spell’s mana cost still see the original value.</p>
<p><a id="cr118.9d"><b>118.9d</b></a> If an alternative cost is being paid to cast a spell, any additional costs, cost increases, and cost reductions that affect that spell are applied to that alternative cost. (See rule <a href="#cr601.2f">601.2f</a>.)</p>
<p><a id="cr118.10"><b>118.10.</b></a> Each payment of a cost applies to only one spell, ability, or effect. For example, a player can’t sacrifice just one creature to activate the activated abilities of two permanents that each require sacrificing a creature as a cost. Also, the resolution of a spell or ability doesn’t pay another spell or ability’s cost, even if part of its effect is doing the same thing the other cost asks for.</p>
<p><a id="cr118.11"><b>118.11.</b></a> The actions performed when paying a cost may be modified by effects. Even if they are, meaning the actions that are performed don’t match the actions that are called for, the cost has still been paid.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> A player controls Psychic Vortex, an enchantment with a cumulative upkeep cost of “Draw a card,” and Obstinate Familiar, a creature that says “If you would draw a card, you may skip that draw instead.” The player may decide to pay Psychic Vortex’s cumulative upkeep cost and then draw no cards instead of drawing the appropriate amount. The cumulative upkeep cost has still been paid.</p>
<p><a id="cr118.12"><b>118.12.</b></a> Some spells, activated abilities, and triggered abilities read, “[Do something]. If [a player] [does, doesn’t, or can’t], [effect].” Or “[A player] may [do something]. If [that player] [does, doesn’t, or can’t], [effect].” The action [do something] is a cost, paid when the spell or ability resolves. The “If [a player] [does, doesn’t, or can’t]” clause checks whether the player chose to pay an optional cost or started to pay a mandatory cost, regardless of what events actually occurred.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> You control Standstill, an enchantment that says “When a player casts a spell, sacrifice Standstill. If you do, each of that player’s opponents draws three cards.” A spell is cast, causing Standstill’s ability to trigger. Then an ability is activated that exiles Standstill. When Standstill’s ability resolves, you’re unable to pay the “sacrifice Standstill” cost. No player will draw cards.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Your opponent has cast Gather Specimens, a spell that says “If a creature would enter the battlefield under an opponent’s control this turn, it enters the battlefield under your control instead.” You control a face-down Dermoplasm, a creature with morph that says “When Dermoplasm is turned face up, you may put a creature card with morph from your hand onto the battlefield face up. If you do, return Dermoplasm to its owner’s hand.” You turn Dermoplasm face up, and you choose to put a creature card with morph from your hand onto the battlefield. Due to Gather Specimens, it enters the battlefield under your opponent’s control instead of yours. However, since you chose to pay the cost, Dermoplasm is still returned to its owner’s hand.</p>
<p><a id="cr118.12a"><b>118.12a</b></a> Some spells, activated abilities, and triggered abilities read, “[Do something] unless [a player does something else].” This means the same thing as “[A player may do something else]. If [that player doesn’t], [do something].”</p>
<p><a id="cr118.12b"><b>118.12b</b></a> Some effects offer a player a choice to search a zone and take additional actions with the cards found in that zone, followed by an “If [a player] does” clause. This clause checks whether the player chose to search, not whether the player took any of the additional actions.</p>
<p><a id="cr118.13"><b>118.13.</b></a> Some costs contain mana symbols that can be paid in multiple ways. These include hybrid mana symbols and Phyrexian mana symbols.</p>
<p><a id="cr118.13a"><b>118.13a</b></a> If the mana cost of a spell or the activation cost of an activated ability contains a mana symbol that can be paid in multiple ways, the choice of how to pay for that symbol is made as its controller proposes that spell or ability (see rule <a href="#cr601.2b">601.2b</a>).</p>
<p><a id="cr118.13b"><b>118.13b</b></a> If a cost paid during the resolution of a spell or ability contains a mana symbol that can be paid in multiple ways, the player paying that cost chooses how to pay for that symbol immediately before they pay that cost.</p>
<p><a id="cr118.13c"><b>118.13c</b></a> If the cost associated with a special action contains a mana symbol that can be paid in multiple ways, the player taking the special action chooses how to pay for that symbol immediately before they pay that cost.</p>

<p><a id="cr119.4b"><b>119.4b</b></a> Players can always pay 0 life, no matter what their (or their team’s) life total is, and even if an effect says players can’t pay life.</p>

<p><a id="cr119.7"><b>119.7.</b></a> If an effect says that a player can’t gain life, that player can’t make an exchange such that the player’s life total would become higher; in that case, the exchange won’t happen. Similarly, if an effect redistributes life totals, a player can’t receive a new life total such that the player’s life total would become higher. In addition, a cost that involves having that player gain life can’t be paid, and a replacement effect that would replace a life gain event affecting that player won’t do anything.</p>
<p><a id="cr119.8"><b>119.8.</b></a> If an effect says that a player can’t lose life, that player can’t make an exchange such that the player’s life total would become lower; in that case, the exchange won’t happen.

<p><a id="cr120.4"><b>120.4.</b></a> Damage is processed in a four-part sequence.</p>
<p><a id="cr120.4a"><b>120.4a</b></a> First, if an effect that’s causing damage to be dealt states that excess damage that would be dealt to a permanent is dealt to another permanent or player instead, the damage event is modified accordingly. If the first permanent is a creature, the excess damage is the amount of damage in excess of what would be lethal damage, taking into account damage already marked on the creature and damage from other sources that would be dealt at the same time. (See rule <a href="#cr120.6">120.6</a>.) Any amount of damage greater than 1 is excess damage if the source dealing that damage to a creature has deathtouch. (See rule <a href="#cr702.2">702.2</a>.) If the first permanent is a planeswalker, the excess damage is the amount of damage in excess of that planeswalker’s loyalty, taking into account damage from other sources that would be dealt at the same time. If the first permanent is both a creature and a planeswalker, the excess damage is the greater of those two amounts.</p>
<p><a id="cr120.4b"><b>120.4b</b></a> Second, damage is dealt, as modified by replacement and prevention effects that interact with damage. (See rule <a href="#cr614">614</a>, “Replacement Effects,” and rule <a href="#cr615">615</a>, “Prevention Effects.”) Abilities that trigger when damage is dealt trigger now and wait to be put on the stack.</p>
<p><a id="cr120.4c"><b>120.4c</b></a> Third, damage that’s been dealt is processed into its results, as modified by replacement effects that interact with those results (such as life loss or counters).</p>
<p><a id="cr120.4d"><b>120.4d</b></a> Finally, the damage event occurs.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> A player who controls Boon Reflection, an enchantment that says “If you would gain life, you gain twice that much life instead,” attacks with a 3/3 creature with wither and lifelink. It’s blocked by a 2/2 creature, and the defending player casts a spell that prevents the next 2 damage that would be dealt to the blocking creature. The damage event starts out as [3 damage is dealt to the 2/2 creature, 2 damage is dealt to the 3/3 creature]. The prevention effect is applied, so the damage event becomes [1 damage is dealt to the 2/2 creature, 2 damage is dealt to the 3/3 creature]. That’s processed into its results, so the damage event is now [one -1/-1 counter is put on the 2/2 creature, the active player gains 1 life, 2 damage is marked on the 3/3 creature]. Boon Reflection’s effect is applied, so the damage event becomes [one -1/-1 counter is put on the 2/2 creature, the active player gains 2 life, 2 damage is marked on the 3/3 creature]. Then the damage event occurs.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> The defending player controls a creature and Worship, an enchantment that says “If you control a creature, damage that would reduce your life total to less than 1 reduces it to 1 instead.” That player is at 2 life, and is being attacked by two unblocked 5/5 creatures. The player casts Awe Strike, which says “The next time target creature would deal damage this turn, prevent that damage. You gain life equal to the damage prevented this way,” targeting one of the attackers. The damage event starts out as [10 damage is dealt to the defending player]. Awe Strike’s effect is applied, so the damage event becomes [5 damage is dealt to the defending player, the defending player gains 5 life]. That’s processed into its results, so the damage event is now [the defending player loses 5 life, the defending player gains 5 life]. Worship’s effect sees that the damage event would not reduce the player’s life total to less than 1, so Worship’s effect is not applied. Then the damage event occurs.</p>
<p><a id="cr120.5"><b>120.5.</b></a> Damage dealt to a creature or planeswalker doesn’t destroy it. Likewise, the source of that damage doesn’t destroy it. Rather, state-based actions may destroy a creature or planeswalker, or otherwise put it into its owner’s graveyard, due to the results of the damage dealt to that permanent. See rule <a href="#cr704.">704.</a><br><b><i>Example:</b></i> A player casts Lightning Bolt, an instant that says “Lightning Bolt deals 3 damage to any target,” targeting a 2/2 creature. After Lightning Bolt deals 3 damage to that creature, the creature is destroyed as a state-based action. Neither Lightning Bolt nor the damage dealt by Lightning Bolt destroyed that creature.</p>
<p><a id="cr120.6"><b>120.6.</b></a> Damage marked on a creature remains until the cleanup step, even if that permanent stops being a creature. If the total damage marked on a creature is greater than or equal to its toughness, that creature has been dealt lethal damage and is destroyed as a state-based action (see rule <a href="#cr704">704</a>). All damage marked on a permanent is removed when it regenerates (see rule <a href="#cr701.15">701.15</a>, “Regenerate”) and during the cleanup step (see rule <a href="#cr514.2">514.2</a>).</p>
<p><a id="cr120.7"><b>120.7.</b></a> The source of damage is the object that dealt it. If an effect requires a player to choose a source of damage, they may choose a permanent; a spell on the stack (including a permanent spell); any object referred to by an object on the stack, by a prevention or replacement effect that’s waiting to apply, or by a delayed triggered ability that’s waiting to trigger (even if that object is no longer in the zone it used to be in); or a face-up object in the command zone. A source doesn’t need to be capable of dealing damage to be a legal choice. See rule <a href="#cr609.7">609.7</a>, “Sources of Damage.”</p>
<p><a id="cr120.8"><b>120.8.</b></a> If a source would deal 0 damage, it does not deal damage at all. That means abilities that trigger on damage being dealt won’t trigger. It also means that replacement effects that would increase the damage dealt by that source, or would have that source deal that damage to a different object or player, have no event to replace, so they have no effect.</p>
<p><a id="cr120.9"><b>120.9.</b></a> If an ability triggers on damage being dealt by a specific source or sources, and the effect refers to the “damage dealt,” it refers only to the damage dealt by the specified sources and not to any damage dealt at the same time by other sources.</p>
<p><a id="cr120.10"><b>120.10.</b></a> Some triggered abilities check whether a permanent has been dealt excess damage. These abilities check after the permanent has been dealt damage by one or more sources. If those sources together dealt an amount of damage to a creature greater than lethal damage, excess damage equal to the difference was dealt to that creature. If those sources together dealt an amount of damage to a planeswalker greater than that planeswalker’s loyalty before the damage was dealt, excess damage equal to the difference was dealt to that planeswalker. If a permanent is both a creature and a planeswalker, the excess damage dealt to that permanent is the greater of those two amounts.</p>

<p><a id="cr121.1"><b>121.1.</b></a> A player draws a card by putting the top card of their library into their hand. This is done as a turn-based action during each player’s draw step. It may also be done as part of a cost or effect of a spell or ability.</p>
<p><a id="cr121.2"><b>121.2.</b></a> Cards may only be drawn one at a time. If a player is instructed to draw multiple cards, that player performs that many individual card draws.</p>
<p><a id="cr121.2a"><b>121.2a</b></a> An instruction to draw multiple cards can be modified by replacement effects that refer to the number of cards drawn. This modification occurs before considering any of the individual card draws. See rule <a href="#cr616.1g">616.1g</a>.</p>
<p><a id="cr121.2b"><b>121.2b</b></a> Some effects say that a player can’t draw more than one card each turn. Such an effect applies to individual card draws. Instructions to draw multiple cards may still be partially carried out. However, if an effect offers the player a choice to draw multiple cards, the affected player can’t choose to do so. Similarly, the player can’t pay a cost that includes drawing multiple cards.</p>
<p><a id="cr121.2c"><b>121.2c</b></a> If more than one player is instructed to draw cards, the active player performs all of their draws first, then each other player in turn order does the same.</p>
<p><a id="cr121.2d"><b>121.2d</b></a> If more than one player is instructed to draw cards in a game that’s using the shared team turns option (such as a Two-Headed Giant game), first each player on the active team, in whatever order that team likes, performs their draws, then each player on each nonactive team in turn order does the same.</p>
<p><a id="cr121.3"><b>121.3.</b></a> If there are no cards in a player’s library and an effect offers that player the choice to draw a card, that player can choose to do so. However, if an effect says that a player can’t draw cards and another effect offers that player the choice to draw a card, that player can’t choose to do so.</p>
<p><a id="cr121.3a"><b>121.3a</b></a> The same principles apply if the player who’s making the choice is not the player who would draw the card. If the latter player has no cards in their library, the choice can be taken. If an effect says that the latter player can’t draw a card, the choice can’t be taken.</p>
<p><a id="cr121.4"><b>121.4.</b></a> A player who attempts to draw a card from a library with no cards in it loses the game the next time a player would receive priority. (This is a state-based action. See rule <a href="#cr704.">704.</a>)</p>
<p><a id="cr121.5"><b>121.5.</b></a> If an effect moves cards from a player’s library to that player’s hand without using the word “draw,” the player has not drawn those cards. This makes a difference for abilities that trigger on drawing cards and effects that replace card draws, as well as if the player’s library is empty.</p>
<p><a id="cr121.6"><b>121.6.</b></a> Some effects replace card draws.</p>
<p><a id="cr121.6a"><b>121.6a</b></a> An effect that replaces a card draw is applied even if no cards could be drawn because there are no cards in the affected player’s library.</p>
<p><a id="cr121.6b"><b>121.6b</b></a> If an effect replaces a draw within a sequence of card draws, the replacement effect is completed before resuming the sequence.</p>
<p><a id="cr121.6c"><b>121.6c</b></a> Some effects perform additional actions on a card after it’s drawn. If the draw is replaced, the additional action is not performed on any cards that are drawn as a result of that replacement effect or any subsequent replacement effects.</p>
<p><a id="cr121.7"><b>121.7.</b></a> Some replacement effects and prevention effects result in one or more card draws. In such a case, if there are any parts of the original event that haven’t been replaced, those parts occur first, then the card draws happen one at a time.</p>
<p><a id="cr121.8"><b>121.8.</b></a> If a spell or ability causes a card to be drawn while another spell is being cast, the drawn card is kept face down until that spell becomes cast (see rule <a href="#cr601.2i">601.2i</a>) or until the casting process is reversed (see rule <a href="#cr726">726</a>, “Handling Illegal Actions”). The same is true with relation to another ability being activated. If an effect allows or instructs a player to reveal the card as it’s being drawn, it’s revealed after the spell becomes cast or the ability becomes activated. While face down, the drawn card is considered to have no characteristics and can’t be used to pay any part of the cost of the spell or ability that would require the card to have specific characteristics.</p>
<p><a id="cr121.9"><b>121.9.</b></a> If an effect gives a player the option to reveal a card as they draw it, that player may look at that card as they draw it before choosing whether to reveal it.</p>
<p><a id="cr122"><b>122. Counters</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr122.1"><b>122.1.</b></a> A counter is a marker placed on an object or player that modifies its characteristics and/or interacts with a rule, ability, or effect. Counters are not objects and have no characteristics. Notably, a counter is not a token, and a token is not a counter. Counters with the same name or description are interchangeable.</p>
<p><a id="cr122.1a"><b>122.1a</b></a> A +X/+Y counter on a creature or on a creature card in a zone other than the battlefield, where X and Y are numbers, adds X to that object’s power and Y to that object’s toughness.

<p><a id="cr201.5"><b>201.5.</b></a> Text that refers to the object it’s on by name means just that particular object and not any other objects with that name, regardless of any name changes caused by game effects.</p>
<p><a id="cr201.5a"><b>201.5a</b></a> If an ability’s effect grants another ability to an object, and that second ability refers to that first ability’s source by name, the name refers only to the specific object which is that first ability’s source. The second ability does not refer to any other object with the same name as the first ability’s source. However, if the second ability also moved the first ability’s source to a different public zone, the name refers to the object the source became in its new zone. This is also true if the second ability is copied onto a new object.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Gutter Grime has an ability that reads “Whenever a nontoken creature you control dies, put a slime counter on Gutter Grime, then create a green Ooze creature token with ‘This creature’s power and toughness are each equal to the number of slime counters on Gutter Grime.’” The ability granted to the token only looks at the Gutter Grime that created the token, not at any other Gutter Grime on the battlefield. A copy of that token would also have an ability that referred only to the Gutter Grime that created the original token.</p>
<p><a id="cr201.5b"><b>201.5b</b></a> If an ability of an object refers to that object by name, and an object with a different name gains that ability, each instance of the first name in the gained ability that refers to the first object by name should be treated as the second name.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Quicksilver Elemental says, in part, “{U}: Quicksilver Elemental gains all activated abilities of target creature until end of turn.” If it gains an ability that says “{G}: Regenerate Cudgel Troll,” activating that ability will regenerate Quicksilver Elemental, not the Cudgel Troll it gained the ability from.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Glacial Ray is an instant with splice onto Arcane that says “Glacial Ray deals 2 damage to any target.” If it’s spliced onto a Kodama’s Reach, that Kodama’s Reach deals 2 damage to the target.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Dimir Doppelganger says “{1}{U}{B}: Exile target creature card from a graveyard. Dimir Doppelganger becomes a copy of that card and gains this ability.” Dimir Doppelganger’s ability is activated targeting a Runeclaw Bear card. The Doppelganger becomes a copy of Runeclaw Bear and gains an ability that should be treated as saying “{1}{U}{B}: Exile target creature card from a graveyard. Runeclaw Bear becomes a copy of that card and gains this ability.”</p>
<p><a id="cr201.5c"><b>201.5c</b></a> Text printed on some legendary cards refers to that card by a shortened version of its name. Instances of a card’s shortened name used in this manner are treated as though they used the card’s full name.</p>

The card’s name as listed in the Oracle card reference is displayed in the secondary title bar, and an alternate name appears in the upper left corner. For the purposes of deck construction, game rules, and effects, these cards have only the card name specified in the secondary title bar. Rules text may also refer to a card’s alternate name; instances of the alternate name that are present in rules text refer to the name specified in the secondary title bar.

<p><a id="cr202"><b>202. Mana Cost and Color</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr202.1"><b>202.1.</b></a> A card’s mana cost is indicated by mana symbols near the top of the card. (See rule <a href="#cr107.4">107.4</a>.) On most cards, these symbols are printed in the upper right corner. Some cards from the Future Sight set have alternate frames in which the mana symbols appear to the left of the illustration.</p>
<p><a id="cr202.1a"><b>202.1a</b></a> The mana cost of an object represents what a player must spend from their mana pool to cast that card. Unless an object’s mana cost includes Phyrexian mana symbols (see rule <a href="#cr107.4f">107.4f</a>), paying that mana cost requires matching the type of any colored or colorless mana symbols as well as paying the generic mana indicated in the cost.</p>
<p><a id="cr202.1b"><b>202.1b</b></a> Some objects have no mana cost. This normally includes all land cards, any other cards that have no mana symbols where their mana cost would appear, tokens (unless the effect that creates them specifies otherwise), and nontraditional Magic cards. Having no mana cost represents an unpayable cost (see rule <a href="#cr118.6">118.6</a>). Note that lands are played without paying any costs (see rule <a href="#cr305">305</a>, “Lands”).</p>
<p><a id="cr202.2"><b>202.2.</b></a> An object is the color or colors of the mana symbols in its mana cost, regardless of the color of its frame.</p>
<p><a id="cr202.2a"><b>202.2a</b></a> The five colors are white, blue, black, red, and green. The white mana symbol is represented by {W}, blue by {U}, black by {B}, red by {R}, and green by {G}.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> An object with a mana cost of {2}{W} is white, an object with a mana cost of {2} is colorless, and one with a mana cost of {2}{W}{B} is both white and black.</p>
<p><a id="cr202.2b"><b>202.2b</b></a> Objects with no colored mana symbols in their mana costs are colorless.</p>
<p><a id="cr202.2c"><b>202.2c</b></a> An object with two or more different colored mana symbols in its mana cost is each of the colors of those mana symbols. Most multicolored cards are printed with a gold frame, but this is not a requirement for a card to be multicolored.</p>
<p><a id="cr202.2d"><b>202.2d</b></a> An object with one or more hybrid mana symbols and/or Phyrexian mana symbols in its mana cost is all of the colors of those mana symbols, in addition to any other colors the object might be. (Most cards with hybrid mana symbols in their mana costs are printed in a two-tone frame. See rule <a href="#cr107.4e">107.4e</a>.)</p>
<p><a id="cr202.2e"><b>202.2e</b></a> An object may have a color indicator printed to the left of the type line. That object is each color denoted by that color indicator. (See rule <a href="#cr204.">204.</a>)</p>
<p><a id="cr202.2f"><b>202.2f</b></a> Effects may change an object’s color, give a color to a colorless object, or make a colored object become colorless; see rule <a href="#cr105.3">105.3</a>.</p>
<p><a id="cr202.3"><b>202.3.</b></a> The mana value of an object is a number equal to the total amount of mana in its mana cost, regardless of color.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> A mana cost of {3}{U}{U} translates to a mana value of 5.</p>
<p><a id="cr202.3a"><b>202.3a</b></a> The mana value of an object with no mana cost is 0, unless that object is the back face of a transforming double-faced permanent or is a melded permanent.</p>
<p><a id="cr202.3b"><b>202.3b</b></a> The mana value of a transforming double-faced permanent or spell’s back face is calculated as though it had the mana cost of its front face. If a permanent or spell is a copy of the back face of a transforming double-faced card (even if the card representing that copy is itself a double-faced card), the mana value of the copy is 0.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Huntmaster of the Fells is a transforming double-faced card with mana cost {2}{R}{G}. Its mana value is 4. After it transforms to its other face (Ravager of the Fells), its mana value remains 4.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> A Clone enters the battlefield as a copy of Ravager of the Fells. Its mana value is 0.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Insectile Aberration is the back face of a transforming double-faced card whose front face has mana cost {U}. It becomes a copy of Ravager of the Fells. Its mana value becomes 0.</p>
<p><a id="cr202.3c"><b>202.3c</b></a> The mana value of a melded permanent is calculated as though it had the combined mana cost of the front faces of each card that represents it. If a permanent is a copy of a melded permanent (even if that copy is represented by two other meld cards), the mana value of the copy is 0.</p>
<p><a id="cr202.3d"><b>202.3d</b></a> The mana value of a split card not on the stack or of a fused split spell on the stack is determined from the combined mana costs of its halves. Otherwise, while a split card is on the stack, the mana value of the spell is determined by the mana cost of the half that was chosen to be cast. See rule <a href="#cr709">709</a>, “Split Cards.”</p>
<p><a id="cr202.3e"><b>202.3e</b></a> When calculating the mana value of an object with an {X} in its mana cost, X is treated as 0 while the object is not on the stack, and X is treated as the number chosen for it while the object is on the stack.</p>
<p><a id="cr202.3f"><b>202.3f</b></a> When calculating the mana value of an object with a hybrid mana symbol in its mana cost, use the largest component of each hybrid symbol.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> The mana value of a card with mana cost {1}{W/U}{W/U} is 3.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> The mana value of a card with mana cost {2/B}{2/B}{2/B} is 6.</p>
<p><a id="cr202.3g"><b>202.3g</b></a> Each Phyrexian mana symbol in a card’s mana cost contributes 1 to its mana value.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> The mana value of a card with mana cost {1}{W/P}{W/P} is 3.</p>
<p><a id="cr202.4"><b>202.4.</b></a> Any additional cost listed in an object’s rules text or imposed by an effect isn’t part of the mana cost. (See rule <a href="#cr601">601</a>, “Casting Spells.”) Such costs are paid at the same time as the spell’s other costs.</p>
<p><a id="cr203"><b>203. Illustration</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr203.1"><b>203.1.</b></a> The illustration is printed on the upper half of a card and has no effect on game play. For example, a creature doesn’t have the flying ability unless stated in its rules text, even if it’s depicted as flying.</p>
<p><a id="cr204"><b>204. Color Indicator</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr204.1"><b>204.1.</b></a> The color indicator is printed to the left of the type line directly below the illustration. It consists of a circular symbol filled in with one or more colors. A color indicator is usually found on nonland cards without a mana cost.</p>
<p><a id="cr204.2"><b>204.2.</b></a> An object with a color indicator is each color denoted by that color indicator.</p>
<p><a id="cr205"><b>205. Type Line</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr205.1"><b>205.1.</b></a> The type line is printed directly below the illustration. It contains the card’s card type(s). It also contains the card’s subtype(s) and supertype(s), if applicable.</p>
<p><a href="#com205"><b>★</b></a> <a id="cr205.1a"><b>205.1a</b></a> Some effects set an object’s card type. In such cases, the new card type(s) replaces any existing card types. Counters, effects, and damage marked on the object remain with it, even if they are meaningless to the new card type. Similarly, when an effect sets one or more of an object’s subtypes, the new subtype(s) replaces any existing subtypes from the appropriate set (creature types, land types, artifact types, enchantment types, planeswalker types, or spell types). If a subtype is correlated with more than one of a card’s existing types, it is replaced only if a new type from each appropriate set is added. If an object’s card type is removed, the subtypes correlated with that card type will remain if they are also the subtypes of a card type the object currently has; otherwise, they are also removed for the entire time the object’s card type is removed. Removing an object’s subtype doesn’t affect its card types at all.</p>
<p><a id="cr205.1b"><b>205.1b</b></a> Some effects change an object’s card type, supertype, or subtype but specify that the object retains a prior card type, supertype, or subtype. In such cases, all the object’s prior card types, supertypes, and subtypes are retained. This rule applies to effects that use the phrase “in addition to its types” or that state that something is “still a [type, supertype, or subtype].” Some effects state that an object becomes an “artifact creature”; these effects also allow the object to retain all of its prior card types and subtypes. Some effects state that an object becomes a “[creature type or types] artifact creature”; these effects also allow the object to retain all of its prior card types and subtypes other than creature types, but replace any existing creature types.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> An ability reads, “All lands are 1/1 creatures that are still lands.” The affected lands now have two card types: creature and land. If there were any lands that were also artifacts before the ability’s effect applied to them, those lands would become “artifact land creatures,” not just “creatures,” or “land creatures.” The effect allows them to retain both the artifact and land card types. In addition, each land affected by the ability retains any land types and supertypes it had before the ability took effect.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> An ability reads, “All artifacts are 1/1 artifact creatures.” If a permanent is both an artifact and an enchantment, it will become an artifact enchantment creature.</p>
<p><a id="cr205.2"><b>205.2.</b></a> Card Types</p>
<p><a id="cr205.2a"><b>205.2a</b></a> The card types are artifact, conspiracy, creature, dungeon, enchantment, instant, land, phenomenon, plane, planeswalker, scheme, sorcery, tribal, and vanguard. See <a href="#cr3">section 3</a>, “Card Types.”</p>
<p><a id="cr205.2b"><b>205.2b</b></a> Some objects have more than one card type (for example, an artifact creature). Such objects satisfy the criteria for any effect that applies to any of their card types.</p>
<p><a id="cr205.2c"><b>205.2c</b></a> Tokens have card types even though they aren’t cards. The same is true of copies of spells and copies of cards.</p>
<p><a id="cr205.3"><b>205.3.</b></a> Subtypes</p>
<p><a id="cr205.3a"><b>205.3a</b></a> A card can have one or more subtypes printed on its type line.</p>
<p><a id="cr205.3b"><b>205.3b</b></a> Subtypes of each card type except plane are always single words and are listed after a long dash. Each word after the dash is a separate subtype; such objects may have multiple types. Subtypes of planes are also listed after a long dash, but may be multiple words; all words after the dash are, collectively, a single subtype.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> “Basic Land — Mountain” means the card is a land with the subtype Mountain. “Creature — Goblin Wizard” means the card is a creature with the subtypes Goblin and Wizard. “Artifact — Equipment” means the card is an artifact with the subtype Equipment.</p>
<p><a href="#com205"><b>★</b></a> <a id="cr205.3c"><b>205.3c</b></a> If a card with multiple card types has one or more subtypes, each subtype is correlated to its appropriate card type or types.</p>
<p><a id="cr205.3d"><b>205.3d</b></a> An object can’t gain a subtype that doesn’t correspond to one of that object’s types.</p>
<p><a id="cr205.3e"><b>205.3e</b></a> If an effect instructs a player to choose a subtype, that player must choose one, and only one, existing subtype, and the subtype must be for the appropriate card type. For example, the player can’t choose a land type if an instruction requires choosing a creature type.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> When choosing a creature type, “Merfolk” or “Wizard” is acceptable, but “Merfolk Wizard” is not. Words like “artifact,” “opponent,” “Swamp,” or “truck” can’t be chosen because they aren’t creature types.</p>

A purple symbol signifies a special rarity; to date, only the Time Spiral® “timeshifted” cards, which were rarer than that set’s rare cards, have had purple expansion symbols. (Prior to the Exodus™ set, all expansion symbols were black, regardless of rarity. Also, prior to the Sixth Edition core set, with the exception of the Simplified Chinese Fifth Edition core set, Magic core sets didn’t have expansion symbols at all.)</p>

<p><a id="cr207"><b>207. Text Box</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr207.1"><b>207.1.</b></a> The text box is printed on the lower half of the card. It usually contains rules text defining the card’s abilities.</p>
<p><b>★</b> <a id="cr207.1a"><b>207.1a</b></a> There is an extended set of ability words. The additional ability words are adorned, armed, art of war, augmented, bulwark, civilized, concord, dominance, duet, foresee, foretold, glorious end, identity, machinate, menagerie, prismatic, rapport, resolute, sabotage, stampede, vanguard, and wanderlust.</p>
<p><a id="cr207.2"><b>207.2.</b></a> The text box may also contain italicized text that has no game function.</p>
<p><a id="cr207.2a"><b>207.2a</b></a> Reminder text is italicized text within parentheses that summarizes a rule that applies to that card. It usually appears on the same line as the ability it’s relevant to, but it may appear on its own line if it applies to an aspect of the card other than an ability.</p>
<p><a id="cr207.2b"><b>207.2b</b></a> Flavor text is italicized text that, like the illustration, adds artistic appeal to the game. It usually appears below the rules text.</p>
<p><a id="cr207.2c"><b>207.2c</b></a> An ability word appears in italics at the beginning of some abilities. Ability words are similar to keywords in that they tie together cards that have similar functionality, but they have no special rules meaning and no individual entries in the Comprehensive Rules. The ability words are adamant, addendum, alliance, battalion, bloodrush, channel, chroma, cohort, constellation, converge, council’s dilemma, coven, delirium, domain, eminence, enrage, fateful hour, ferocious, formidable, grandeur, hellbent, heroic, imprint, inspired, join forces, kinship, landfall, lieutenant, magecraft, metalcraft, morbid, pack tactics, parley, radiance, raid, rally, revolt, spell mastery, strive, sweep, tempting offer, threshold, undergrowth, and will of the council.</p>
<p><a id="cr207.2d"><b>207.2d</b></a> Similar to ability words, flavor words appear in italics at the beginning of some abilities. Flavor words provide a flavorful description of abilities, but they have no special rules meaning and are not listed in the Comprehensive Rules. While an ability word ties together several abilities with similar functionality, each flavor word is tailored to the specific ability it appears with.</p>
<p><a id="cr207.3"><b>207.3.</b></a> Some cards have decorative icons in the background of their text boxes. For example, a guild icon appears in the text box of many cards associated with the guilds of Ravnica, and a faction icon appears in the text box of most Scars of Mirrodin™ block cards. Similarly, many promotional cards include decorative icons. These icons have no effect on game play.</p>
<p><a id="cr207.4"><b>207.4.</b></a> The chaos symbol {CHAOS} appears in the text box of each plane card to the left of a triggered ability that triggers whenever {CHAOS} is rolled on the planar die. The symbol itself has no special rules meaning. See rule <a href="#cr901">901</a>, “Planechase.”</p>
<p><a id="cr208"><b>208. Power/Toughness</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr208.1"><b>208.1.</b></a> A creature card has two numbers separated by a slash printed in its lower right corner. The first number is its power (the amount of damage it deals in combat); the second is its toughness (the amount of damage needed to destroy it). For example, 2/3 means the object has power 2 and toughness 3. Power and toughness can be modified or set to particular values by effects.</p>
<p><a id="cr208.2"><b>208.2.</b></a> Rather than a fixed number, some creature cards have power and/or toughness that includes a star (*).</p>
<p><a id="cr208.2a"><b>208.2a</b></a> The card may have a characteristic-defining ability that sets its power and/or toughness according to some stated condition. (See rule <a href="#cr604.3">604.3</a>.) Such an ability is worded “[This creature’s] [power or toughness] is equal to . . .” or “[This creature’s] power and toughness are each equal to . . .” This ability functions everywhere, even outside the game. If the ability needs to use a number that can’t be determined, including inside a calculation, use 0 instead of that number.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Lost Order of Jarkeld has power and toughness each equal to 1+*. It has the abilities “As Lost Order of Jarkeld enters the battlefield, choose an opponent” and “Lost Order of Jarkeld’s power and toughness are each equal to 1 plus the number of creatures the chosen player controls.” While Lost Order of Jarkeld isn’t on the battlefield, there won’t be a chosen player. Its power and toughness will each be equal to 1 plus 0, so it’s 1/1.</p>
<p><a id="cr208.2b"><b>208.2b</b></a> The card may have a static ability that creates a replacement effect that sets the creature’s power and toughness to one of a number of specific values as it enters the battlefield or is turned face up. (See rule <a href="#cr614">614</a>, “Replacement Effects.”) Such an ability is worded “As [this creature] enters the battlefield . . . ,” “As [this creature] is turned face up . . . ,” or “[This creature] enters the battlefield as . . .” and lists two or more specific power and toughness values (and may also list additional characteristics). The characteristics chosen or determined with these effects affect the creature’s copiable values. (See rule <a href="#cr707.2">707.2</a>.) While the card isn’t on the battlefield, its power and toughness are each considered to be 0.</p>
<p><a id="cr208.3"><b>208.3.</b></a> A noncreature permanent has no power or toughness, even if it’s a card with a power and toughness printed on it (such as a Vehicle). A noncreature object not on the battlefield has power or toughness only if it has a power and toughness printed on it.</p>
<p><a id="cr208.3a"><b>208.3a</b></a> If an effect would be created that affects the power and/or toughness of a noncreature permanent, that effect is created even though it doesn’t do anything unless that permanent becomes a creature.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Veteran Motorist has the ability “Whenever Veteran Motorist crews a Vehicle, that Vehicle gets +1/+1 until end of turn,” and it’s tapped to pay the crew cost of a Vehicle. This triggered ability resolves while the Vehicle it crewed isn’t yet a creature. The continuous effect is created and will apply to the Vehicle once it becomes a creature.</p>
<p><a id="cr208.4"><b>208.4.</b></a> Some effects refer to a creature’s “base power,” “base toughness,” or “base power and toughness.”</p>
<p><a id="cr208.4a"><b>208.4a</b></a> Effects that set a creature’s power and/or toughness to specific values may refer to base power and/or toughness. Other continuous effects may further modify the creature’s power and toughness. See rule <a href="#cr613">613</a>, “Interaction of Continuous Effects.”</p>
<p><a id="cr208.4b"><b>208.4b</b></a> Some effects check a creature’s base power and/or toughness. These effects see that creature’s characteristics after applying any characteristic-defining abilities and abilities that set power and/or toughness, ignoring any effects and counters that modify power and/or toughness without setting them. See rule <a href="#cr613">613</a>, “Interaction of Continuous Effects.”</p>
<p><a id="cr208.5"><b>208.5.</b></a> If a creature somehow has no value for its power, its power is 0. The same is true for toughness.</p>
<p><a id="cr209"><b>209. Loyalty</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr209.1"><b>209.1.</b></a> Each planeswalker card has a loyalty number printed in its lower right corner. This indicates its loyalty while it’s not on the battlefield, and it also indicates that the planeswalker enters the battlefield with that many loyalty counters on it (see rule <a href="#cr306.5b">306.5b</a>).</p>
<p><a id="cr209.2"><b>209.2.</b></a> An activated ability with a loyalty symbol in its cost is a loyalty ability. Loyalty abilities follow special rules: A player may activate a loyalty ability of a permanent they control any time they have priority and the stack is empty during a main phase of their turn, but only if none of that permanent’s loyalty abilities have been activated that turn. See rule <a href="#cr606">606</a>, “Loyalty Abilities.”</p>
<p><a id="cr210"><b>210. Hand Modifier</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr210.1"><b>210.1.</b></a> Each vanguard card has a hand modifier printed in its lower left corner. This is a number preceded by a plus sign, a number preceded by a minus sign, or a zero. This modifier is applied as the starting hand size and the maximum hand size of the vanguard card’s owner are determined. See rule <a href="#cr103.4">103.4</a>.</p>
<p><a id="cr211"><b>211. Life Modifier</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr211.1"><b>211.1.</b></a> Each vanguard card has a life modifier printed in its lower right corner. This is a number preceded by a plus sign, a number preceded by a minus sign, or a zero. This modifier is applied as the starting life total of the vanguard card’s owner is determined. See rule <a href="#cr103.3">103.3</a>.</p>
<p><a id="cr212"><b>212. Information Below the Text Box</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr212.1"><b>212.1.</b></a> Each card features text printed below the text box that has no effect on game play. Not all card sets were printed with all of the information listed below on each card.</p>
<p><a id="cr212.1a"><b>212.1a</b></a> Most card sets feature collector numbers. This information is printed in the form [card number]/[total cards in the set] or simply [card number]. Some cards, such as unique cards in Planeswalker Decks, have card numbers that exceed the listed total number of cards.</p>
<p><a id="cr212.1b"><b>212.1b</b></a> A card’s rarity is indicated with a single letter following the collector number.</p>
<p><a id="cr212.1c"><b>212.1c</b></a> Some promotional cards include information to indicate the specific promotion the card is associated with.</p>
<p><a id="cr212.1d"><b>212.1d</b></a> Some cards with interchangeable names include information about a specific version of a card with that interchangeable name. See rule <a href="#cr201.3">201.3</a>.</p>
<p><a id="cr212.1e"><b>212.1e</b></a> The three-character code representing the set in which a card is printed and the two-character code representing the language in which a card is printed are separated by a bullet point. If a card is premium, these codes are instead separated by a star.</p>
<p><a id="cr212.1f"><b>212.1f</b></a> The illustration credit for a card follows the paintbrush icon or, on older cards, the abbreviation “Illus.”</p>
<p><a id="cr212.1g"><b>212.1g</b></a> Legal text (the fine print at the bottom or bottom-right of the card) lists the trademark and copyright information.</p>
<a id="cr3"><b>3. Card Types</b></a><p><a id="cr300"><b>300. General</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr300.1"><b>300.1.</b></a> The card types are artifact, conspiracy, creature, dungeon, enchantment, instant, land, phenomenon, plane, planeswalker, scheme, sorcery, tribal, and vanguard.</p>
<p><a id="cr300.2"><b>300.2.</b></a> Some objects have more than one card type (for example, an artifact creature). Such objects combine the aspects of each of those card types, and are subject to spells and abilities that affect either or all of those card types.</p>
<p><a id="cr300.2a"><b>300.2a</b></a> An object that’s both a land and another card type (for example, an artifact land) can only be played as a land. It can’t be cast as a spell.</p>
<p><a id="cr300.2b"><b>300.2b</b></a> Each tribal card has another card type. Casting and resolving a tribal card follow the rules for casting and resolving a card of the other card type.</p>
<p><a id="cr301"><b>301. Artifacts</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr301.1"><b>301.1.</b></a> A player who has priority may cast an artifact card from their hand during a main phase of their turn when the stack is empty. Casting an artifact as a spell uses the stack. (See rule <a href="#cr601">601</a>, “Casting Spells.”)</p>
<p><a id="cr301.2"><b>301.2.</b></a> When an artifact spell resolves, its controller puts it onto the battlefield under their control.</p>
<p><a id="cr301.3"><b>301.3.</b></a> Artifact subtypes are always a single word and are listed after a long dash: “Artifact — Equipment.” Artifact subtypes are also called artifact types. Artifacts may have multiple subtypes. See rule <a href="#cr205.3g">205.3g</a> for the complete list of artifact types.</p>
<p><a id="cr301.4"><b>301.4.</b></a> Artifacts have no characteristics specific to their card type. Most artifacts have no colored mana symbols in their mana costs, and are therefore colorless. However, there is no correlation between being colorless and being an artifact: artifacts may be colored, and colorless objects may be card types other than artifact.</p>
<p><a id="cr301.5"><b>301.5.</b></a> Some artifacts have the subtype “Equipment.” An Equipment can be attached to a creature. It can’t legally be attached to anything that isn’t a creature.</p>
<p><a id="cr301.5a"><b>301.5a</b></a> The creature an Equipment is attached to is called the “equipped creature.” The Equipment is attached to, or “equips,” that creature.</p>
<p><a id="cr301.5b"><b>301.5b</b></a> Equipment spells are cast like other artifact spells. Equipment enter the battlefield like other artifacts. They don’t enter the battlefield attached to a creature. The equip keyword ability attaches the Equipment to a creature you control (see rule <a href="#cr702.6">702.6</a>, “Equip”). Control of the creature matters only when the equip ability is activated and when it resolves. Spells and other abilities may also attach an Equipment to a creature. If an effect attempts to attach an Equipment to an object that can’t be equipped by it, the Equipment doesn’t move.</p>
<p><a id="cr301.5c"><b>301.5c</b></a> An Equipment that’s also a creature can’t equip a creature unless that Equipment has reconfigure (see rule <a href="#cr702.151">702.151</a>, “Reconfigure”). An Equipment that loses the subtype “Equipment” can’t equip a creature. An Equipment can’t equip itself. An Equipment that equips an illegal or nonexistent permanent becomes unattached from that permanent but remains on the battlefield. (This is a state-based action. See rule <a href="#cr704.">704.</a>) An Equipment can’t equip more than one creature. If a spell or ability would cause an Equipment to equip more than one creature, the Equipment’s controller chooses which creature it equips.</p>
<p><a id="cr301.5d"><b>301.5d</b></a> An Equipment’s controller is separate from the equipped creature’s controller; the two need not be the same. Changing control of the creature doesn’t change control of the Equipment, and vice versa. Only the Equipment’s controller can activate its abilities. However, if the Equipment grants an ability to the equipped creature (with “gains” or “has”), the equipped creature’s controller is the only one who can activate that ability.</p>
<p><a id="cr301.5e"><b>301.5e</b></a> An ability of a permanent that refers to the “equipped creature” refers to whatever creature that permanent is attached to, even if the permanent with the ability isn’t an Equipment.</p>
<p><a id="cr301.6"><b>301.6.</b></a> Some artifacts have the subtype “Fortification.” A Fortification can be attached to a land. It can’t legally be attached to an object that isn’t a land. Fortification’s analog to the equip keyword ability is the fortify keyword ability. Rules 301.5a–e apply to Fortifications in relation to lands just as they apply to Equipment in relation to creatures, with one clarification relating to rule <a href="#cr301.5c">301.5c</a>: a Fortification that’s also a creature (not a land) can’t fortify a land. (See rule <a href="#cr702.67">702.67</a>, “Fortify.”)</p>
<p><a id="cr301.7"><b>301.7.</b></a> Some artifacts have the subtype “Vehicle.” Most Vehicles have a crew ability which allows them to become artifact creatures. See rule <a href="#cr702.122">702.122</a>, “Crew.”</p>
<p><a id="cr301.7a"><b>301.7a</b></a> Each Vehicle has a printed power and toughness, but it has these characteristics only if it’s also a creature. See rule <a href="#cr208.3">208.3</a>.</p>
<p><a id="cr301.7b"><b>301.7b</b></a> If a Vehicle becomes a creature, it immediately has its printed power and toughness. Other effects, including the effect that makes it a creature, may modify these values or set them to different values.</p>
<p><a id="cr302"><b>302. Creatures</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr302.1"><b>302.1.</b></a> A player who has priority may cast a creature card from their hand during a main phase of their turn when the stack is empty. Casting a creature as a spell uses the stack. (See rule <a href="#cr601">601</a>, “Casting Spells.”)</p>
<p><a id="cr302.2"><b>302.2.</b></a> When a creature spell resolves, its controller puts it onto the battlefield under their control.</p>
<p><a id="cr302.3"><b>302.3.</b></a> Creature subtypes are always a single word and are listed after a long dash: “Creature — Human Soldier,” “Artifact Creature — Golem,” and so on. Creature subtypes are also called creature types. Creatures may have multiple subtypes. See rule <a href="#cr205.3s">205.3s</a> for the complete list of creature types.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> “Creature — Goblin Wizard” means the card is a creature with the subtypes Goblin and Wizard.</p>
<p><a id="cr302.4"><b>302.4.</b></a> Power and toughness are characteristics only creatures have.</p>
<p><a id="cr302.4a"><b>302.4a</b></a> A creature’s power is the amount of damage it deals in combat.</p>
<p><a id="cr302.4b"><b>302.4b</b></a> A creature’s toughness is the amount of damage needed to destroy it.</p>
<p><a id="cr302.4c"><b>302.4c</b></a> To determine a creature’s power and toughness, start with the numbers printed in its lower right corner, then apply any applicable continuous effects. (See rule <a href="#cr613">613</a>, “Interaction of Continuous Effects.”)</p>
<p><a id="cr302.5"><b>302.5.</b></a> Creatures can attack and block. (See rule <a href="#cr508">508</a>, “Declare Attackers Step,” and rule <a href="#cr509">509</a>, “Declare Blockers Step.”)</p>
<p><a id="cr302.6"><b>302.6.</b></a> A creature’s activated ability with the tap symbol or the untap symbol in its activation cost can’t be activated unless the creature has been under its controller’s control continuously since their most recent turn began. A creature can’t attack unless it has been under its controller’s control continuously since their most recent turn began. This rule is informally called the “summoning sickness” rule.</p>
<p><a id="cr302.7"><b>302.7.</b></a> Damage dealt to a creature by a source with neither wither nor infect is marked on that creature (see rule <a href="#cr120.3">120.3</a>). If the total damage marked on that creature is greater than or equal to its toughness, that creature has been dealt lethal damage and is destroyed as a state-based action (see rule <a href="#cr704">704</a>). All damage marked on a creature is removed when it regenerates (see rule <a href="#cr701.15">701.15</a>, “Regenerate”) and during the cleanup step (see rule <a href="#cr514.2">514.2</a>).</p>
<p><b>★</b> <a id="cr302.8"><b>302.8.</b></a> If a creature was dealt damage since the last time state-based actions were checked, and that creature is still on the battlefield and a creature after state-based actions are checked, that creature “survived damage”.</p>
<p><a id="cr303"><b>303. Enchantments</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr303.1"><b>303.1.</b></a> A player who has priority may cast an enchantment card from their hand during a main phase of their turn when the stack is empty. Casting an enchantment as a spell uses the stack. (See rule <a href="#cr601">601</a>, “Casting Spells.”)</p>
<p><a id="cr303.2"><b>303.2.</b></a> When an enchantment spell resolves, its controller puts it onto the battlefield under their control.</p>
<p><a id="cr303.3"><b>303.3.</b></a> Enchantment subtypes are always a single word and are listed after a long dash: “Enchantment — Shrine.” Each word after the dash is a separate subtype. Enchantment subtypes are also called enchantment types. Enchantments may have multiple subtypes. See rule <a href="#cr205.3i">205.3i</a> for the complete list of enchantment types.</p>
<p><a id="cr303.4"><b>303.4.</b></a> Some enchantments have the subtype “Aura.” An Aura enters the battlefield attached to an object or player. What an Aura can be attached to is defined by its enchant keyword ability (see rule <a href="#cr702.5">702.5</a>, “Enchant”). Other effects can limit what a permanent can be enchanted by.</p>

<p><a id="cr305.1"><b>305.1.</b></a> A player who has priority may play a land card from their hand during a main phase of their turn when the stack is empty. Playing a land is a special action; it doesn’t use the stack (see rule <a href="#cr116">116</a>). Rather, the player simply puts the land onto the battlefield.

<p><a id="cr305.2a"><b>305.2a</b></a> To determine whether a player can play a land, compare the number of lands the player can play this turn with the number of lands they have already played this turn (including lands played as special actions and lands played during the resolution of spells and abilities).

<p><a id="cr305.6"><b>305.6.</b></a> The basic land types are Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain, and Forest. If an object uses the words “basic land type,” it’s referring to one of these subtypes. An object with the land card type and a basic land type has the intrinsic ability “{T}: Add [mana symbol],” even if the text box doesn’t actually contain that text or the object has no text box. For Plains, [mana symbol] is {W}; for Islands, {U}; for Swamps, {B}; for Mountains, {R}; and for Forests, {G}. See rule <a href="#cr107.4a">107.4a</a>. See also rule <a href="#cr605">605</a>, “Mana Abilities.”</p>
<p><a id="cr305.7"><b>305.7.</b></a> If an effect sets a land’s subtype to one or more of the basic land types, the land no longer has its old land type. It loses all abilities generated from its rules text, its old land types, and any copiable effects affecting that land, and it gains the appropriate mana ability for each new basic land type. Note that this doesn’t remove any abilities that were granted to the land by other effects. Setting a land’s subtype doesn’t add or remove any card types (such as creature) or supertypes (such as basic, legendary, and snow) the land may have. If a land gains one or more land types in addition to its own, it keeps its land types and rules text, and it gains the new land types and mana abilities.</p>
<p><a id="cr305.8"><b>305.8.</b></a> Any land with the supertype “basic” is a basic land. Any land that doesn’t have this supertype is a nonbasic land, even if it has a basic land type.</p>
<p><a id="cr305.9"><b>305.9.</b></a> If an object is both a land and another card type, it can be played only as a land. It can’t be cast as a spell.</p>

<p><a id="cr400.1"><b>400.1.</b></a> A zone is a place where objects can be during a game. There are normally seven zones: library, hand, battlefield, graveyard, stack, exile, and command. Some older cards also use the ante zone. Each player has their own library, hand, and graveyard. The other zones are shared by all players.</p>
<p><a id="cr400.2"><b>400.2.</b></a> Public zones are zones in which all players can see the cards’ faces, except for those cards that some rule or effect specifically allow to be face down. Graveyard, battlefield, stack, exile, ante, and command are public zones. Hidden zones are zones in which not all players can be expected to see the cards’ faces. Library and hand are hidden zones, even if all the cards in one such zone happen to be revealed.</p>
<p><a id="cr400.3"><b>400.3.</b></a> If an object would go to any library, graveyard, or hand other than its owner’s, it goes to its owner’s corresponding zone.</p>
<p><a id="cr400.4"><b>400.4.</b></a> Cards with certain card types can’t enter certain zones.</p>
<p><a id="cr400.4a"><b>400.4a</b></a> If an instant or sorcery card would enter the battlefield, it remains in its previous zone.</p>
<p><a id="cr400.4b"><b>400.4b</b></a> If a conspiracy, phenomenon, plane, scheme, or vanguard card would leave the command zone, it remains in the command zone.</p>
<p><a id="cr400.5"><b>400.5.</b></a> The order of objects in a library, in a graveyard, or on the stack can’t be changed except when effects or rules allow it. The same is true for objects arranged in face-down piles in other zones. Other objects in other zones can be arranged however their owners wish, although who controls those objects, whether they’re tapped or flipped, and what other objects are attached to them must remain clear to all players.</p>
<p><a id="cr400.6"><b>400.6.</b></a> If an object would move from one zone to another, determine what event is moving the object. If the object is moving to a public zone and its owner will be able to look at it in that zone, its owner looks at it to see if it has any abilities that would affect the move. If the object is moving to the battlefield, each other player who will be able to look at it in that zone does so. Then any appropriate replacement effects, whether they come from that object or from elsewhere, are applied to that event. If any effects or rules try to do two or more contradictory or mutually exclusive things to a particular object, that object’s controller—or its owner if it has no controller—chooses which effect to apply, and what that effect does. (Note that multiple instances of the same thing may be mutually exclusive; for example, two simultaneous “destroy” effects.) Then the event moves the object.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Exquisite Archangel has an ability which reads “If you would lose the game, instead exile Exquisite Archangel and your life total becomes equal to your starting life total.” A spell deals 5 damage to a player with 5 life and 5 damage to an Exquisite Archangel under that player’s control. As state-based actions are performed, that player’s life total becomes equal to their starting life total, and that player chooses whether Exquisite Archangel moves to its owner’s graveyard or to exile.</p>
<p><a id="cr400.7"><b>400.7.</b></a> An object that moves from one zone to another becomes a new object with no memory of, or relation to, its previous existence. There are nine exceptions to this rule:</p>
<p><a id="cr400.7a"><b>400.7a</b></a> Effects from spells, activated abilities, and triggered abilities that change the characteristics or controller of a permanent spell on the stack continue to apply to the permanent that spell becomes.</p>
<p><a id="cr400.7b"><b>400.7b</b></a> Prevention effects that apply to damage from a permanent spell on the stack continue to apply to damage from the permanent that spell becomes.</p>
<p><a id="cr400.7c"><b>400.7c</b></a> An ability of a permanent can reference information about the spell that became that permanent as it resolved, including what costs were paid to cast that spell or what mana was spent to pay those costs.</p>
<p><a id="cr400.7d"><b>400.7d</b></a> Abilities that trigger when an object moves from one zone to another (for example, “When Rancor is put into a graveyard from the battlefield”) can find the new object that it became in the zone it moved to when the ability triggered, if that zone is a public zone.</p>
<p><a id="cr400.7e"><b>400.7e</b></a> Abilities of Auras that trigger when the enchanted permanent leaves the battlefield can find the new object that Aura became in its owner’s graveyard if it was put into that graveyard at the same time the enchanted permanent left the battlefield. It can also find the new object that Aura became in its owner’s graveyard as a result of being put there as a state-based action for not being attached to a permanent. (See rule <a href="#cr704.5m">704.5m</a>.)</p>
<p><a id="cr400.7f"><b>400.7f</b></a> If an effect grants a nonland card an ability that allows it to be cast, that ability will continue to apply to the new object that card became after it moved to the stack as a result of being cast this way.</p>
<p><a id="cr400.7g"><b>400.7g</b></a> If an effect allows a nonland card to be cast, other parts of that effect can find the new object that card becomes after it moves to the stack as a result of being cast this way.</p>
<p><a id="cr400.7h"><b>400.7h</b></a> If an effect causes an object to move to a public zone, other parts of that effect can find that object. If the cost of a spell or ability causes an object to move to a public zone, that spell or ability’s effects can find that object.</p>
<p><a id="cr400.7i"><b>400.7i</b></a> After resolving a madness triggered ability (see rule <a href="#cr702.35">702.35</a>), if the exiled card wasn’t cast and was moved to a public zone, effects referencing the discarded card can find that object.</p>
<p><a id="cr400.8"><b>400.8.</b></a> If an object in the exile zone is exiled, it doesn’t change zones, but it becomes a new object that has just been exiled.</p>
<p><a id="cr400.9"><b>400.9.</b></a> If a face-up object in the command zone is turned face down, it becomes a new object.</p>

<p><a id="cr400.11a"><b>400.11a</b></a> Cards in a player’s sideboard are outside the game. See rule <a href="#cr100.4">100.4</a>.</p>
<p><a id="cr400.11b"><b>400.11b</b></a> Some effects bring cards into a game from outside the game. Those cards remain in the game until the game ends, their owner leaves the game, or a rule or effect removes them from the game, whichever comes first.</p>
<p><a id="cr400.11c"><b>400.11c</b></a> Cards outside the game can’t be affected by spells or abilities, except for characteristic-defining abilities printed on them (see rule <a href="#cr604.3">604.3</a>) and spells and abilities that allow those cards to be brought into the game.</p>
<p><a id="cr400.12"><b>400.12.</b></a> Some effects instruct a player to do something to a zone (such as “Shuffle your hand into your library”). That action is performed on all cards in that zone. The zone itself is not affected.</p>
<p><a id="cr401"><b>401. Library</b></a></p>
<p><a href="#com401"><b>★</b></a> <a id="cr401.1"><b>401.1.</b></a> When a game begins, each player’s deck becomes their main library.</p>
<p><a href="#com401"><b>★</b></a> <a id="cr401.2"><b>401.2.</b></a> Each main library must be kept in a single face-down pile. Players can’t look at or change the order of cards in a library.</p>
<p><a id="cr401.3"><b>401.3.</b></a> Any player may count the number of cards remaining in any player’s library at any time.</p>
<p><a id="cr401.4"><b>401.4.</b></a> If an effect puts two or more cards in a specific position in a library at the same time, the owner of those cards may arrange them in any order. That library’s owner doesn’t reveal the order in which the cards go into the library.</p>
<p><a id="cr401.5"><b>401.5.</b></a> Some effects tell a player to play with the top card of their library revealed, or say that a player may look at the top card of their library. If the top card of the player’s library changes while a spell is being cast, the new top card won’t be revealed and can’t be looked at until the spell becomes cast (see rule <a href="#cr601.2i">601.2i</a>). The same is true with relation to an ability being activated.</p>
<p><a id="cr401.6"><b>401.6.</b></a> If an effect causes a player to play with the top card of their library revealed, and that particular card stops being revealed for any length of time before being revealed again, it becomes a new object.</p>
<p><a id="cr401.7"><b>401.7.</b></a> If an effect causes a player to put a card into a library “Nth from the top,” and that library has fewer than N cards in it, the player puts that card on the bottom of that library.</p>
<p><a id="cr402"><b>402. Hand</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr402.1"><b>402.1.</b></a> The hand is where a player holds cards that have been drawn. Cards can be put into a player’s hand by other effects as well. At the beginning of the game, each player draws a number of cards equal to that player’s starting hand size, normally seven. (See rule <a href="#cr103">103</a>, “Starting the Game.”)</p>
<p><a id="cr402.2"><b>402.2.</b></a> Each player has a maximum hand size, which is normally seven cards. A player may have any number of cards in their hand, but as part of their cleanup step, the player must discard excess cards down to the maximum hand size.</p>
<p><a id="cr402.3"><b>402.3.</b></a> A player may arrange their hand in any convenient fashion and look at it at any time. A player can’t look at the cards in another player’s hand but may count those cards at any time.</p>
<p><a id="cr403"><b>403. Battlefield</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr403.1"><b>403.1.</b></a> Most of the area between the players represents the battlefield. The battlefield starts out empty. Permanents a player controls are normally kept in front of them on the battlefield, though there are some cases (such as an Aura attached to another player’s permanent) when a permanent one player controls is kept closer to a different player.</p>
<p><a id="cr403.2"><b>403.2.</b></a> A spell or ability affects and checks only the battlefield unless it specifically mentions a player or another zone.</p>
<p><a id="cr403.3"><b>403.3.</b></a> Permanents exist only on the battlefield. Every object on the battlefield is a permanent. See rule <a href="#cr110">110</a>, “Permanents.”</p>
<p><a id="cr403.4"><b>403.4.</b></a> Whenever a permanent enters the battlefield, it becomes a new object and has no relationship to any previous permanent represented by the same card, except for the cases listed in rule <a href="#cr400.7">400.7</a>. (This is also true for any objects entering any zone.)</p>
<p><a id="cr403.5"><b>403.5.</b></a> Previously, the battlefield was called the “in-play zone.” Cards that were printed with text that contains the phrases “in play,” “from play,” “into play,” or the like are referring to the battlefield. Cards that were printed with that text have received errata in the Oracle card reference.</p>
<p><a id="cr404"><b>404. Graveyard</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr404.1"><b>404.1.</b></a> A player’s graveyard is their discard pile. Any object that’s countered, discarded, destroyed, or sacrificed is put on top of its owner’s graveyard, as is any instant or sorcery spell that’s finished resolving. Each player’s graveyard starts out empty.</p>
<p><a id="cr404.2"><b>404.2.</b></a> Each graveyard is kept in a single face-up pile. A player can examine the cards in any graveyard at any time but normally can’t change their order. Additional rules applying to sanctioned tournaments may allow a player to change the order of cards in their graveyard.</p>
<p><a id="cr404.3"><b>404.3.</b></a> If an effect or rule puts two or more cards into the same graveyard at the same time, the owner of those cards may arrange them in any order.</p>
<p><a id="cr405"><b>405. Stack</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr405.1"><b>405.1.</b></a> When a spell is cast, the physical card is put on the stack (see rule <a href="#cr601.2a">601.2a</a>). When an ability is activated or triggers, it goes on top of the stack without any card associated with it (see rules <a href="#cr602.2a">602.2a</a> and <a href="#cr603.3">603.3</a>).</p>
<p><a id="cr405.2"><b>405.2.</b></a> The stack keeps track of the order that spells and/or abilities were added to it. Each time an object is put on the stack, it’s put on top of all objects already there.</p>
<p><a id="cr405.3"><b>405.3.</b></a> If an effect puts two or more objects on the stack at the same time, those controlled by the active player are put on lowest, followed by each other player’s objects in APNAP order (see rule <a href="#cr101.4">101.4</a>). If a player controls more than one of these objects, that player chooses their relative order on the stack.</p>
<p><a id="cr405.4"><b>405.4.</b></a> Each spell has all the characteristics of the card associated with it. Each activated or triggered ability that’s on the stack has the text of the ability that created it and no other characteristics. The controller of a spell is the person who cast it. The controller of an activated ability is the player who activated it. The controller of a triggered ability is the player who controlled the ability’s source when it triggered, unless it’s a delayed triggered ability. To determine the controller of a delayed triggered ability, see rules <a href="#cr603.7d">603.7d</a>–f.</p>
<p><a id="cr405.5"><b>405.5.</b></a> When all players pass in succession, the top (last-added) spell or ability on the stack resolves. If the stack is empty when all players pass, the current step or phase ends and the next begins.</p>
<p><a id="cr405.6"><b>405.6.</b></a> Some things that happen during the game don’t use the stack.</p>
<p><a id="cr405.6a"><b>405.6a</b></a> Effects don’t go on the stack; they’re the result of spells and abilities resolving. Effects may create delayed triggered abilities, however, and these may go on the stack when they trigger (see rule <a href="#cr603.7">603.7</a>).</p>
<p><a id="cr405.6b"><b>405.6b</b></a> Static abilities continuously generate effects and don’t go on the stack. (See rule <a href="#cr604">604</a>, “Handling Static Abilities.”) This includes characteristic-defining abilities such as “[This object] is red” (see rule <a href="#cr604.3">604.3</a>).</p>
<p><a id="cr405.6c"><b>405.6c</b></a> Mana abilities resolve immediately. If a mana ability both produces mana and has another effect, the mana is produced and the other effect happens immediately. If a player had priority before a mana ability was activated, that player gets priority after it resolves. (See rule <a href="#cr605">605</a>, “Mana Abilities.”)</p>
<p><a id="cr405.6d"><b>405.6d</b></a> Special actions don’t use the stack; they happen immediately. See rule <a href="#cr116">116</a>, “Special Actions.”</p>
<p><a id="cr405.6e"><b>405.6e</b></a> Turn-based actions don’t use the stack; they happen automatically when certain steps or phases begin. They’re dealt with before a player would receive priority (see rule <a href="#cr117.3a">117.3a</a>). Turn-based actions also happen automatically when each step and phase ends; no player receives priority afterward. See rule <a href="#cr703.">703.</a></p>
<p><a id="cr405.6f"><b>405.6f</b></a> State-based actions don’t use the stack; they happen automatically when certain conditions are met. See rule <a href="#cr704.">704.</a> They are dealt with before a player would receive priority. See rule <a href="#cr117.5">117.5</a>.</p>
<p><a id="cr405.6g"><b>405.6g</b></a> A player may concede the game at any time. That player leaves the game immediately. See rule <a href="#cr104.3a">104.3a</a>.</p>
<p><a id="cr405.6h"><b>405.6h</b></a> If a player leaves a multiplayer game, objects may leave the game, cease to exist, change control, or be exiled as a result. These actions happen immediately. See rule <a href="#cr800.4a">800.4a</a>.</p>
<p><a id="cr406"><b>406. Exile</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr406.1"><b>406.1.</b></a> The exile zone is essentially a holding area for objects. Some spells and abilities exile an object without any way to return that object to another zone. Other spells and abilities exile an object only temporarily.</p>
<p><a id="cr406.2"><b>406.2.</b></a> To exile an object is to put it into the exile zone from whatever zone it’s currently in. An exiled card is a card that’s been put into the exile zone.</p>
<p><a id="cr406.3"><b>406.3.</b></a> Exiled cards are, by default, kept face up and may be examined by any player at any time. Cards “exiled face down” can’t be examined by any player except when instructions allow it. However, if a player is instructed to look at a card and then exile it face down, or once a player is allowed to look at a card exiled face down, that player may continue to look at that card as long as it remains exiled, even if the instruction allowing the player to do so no longer applies.</p>
<p><a id="cr406.3a"><b>406.3a</b></a> A card exiled face down has no characteristics, but the spell or ability that exiled it may allow it to be played from exile. Unless that card is being cast face down (see rule <a href="#cr708.4">708.4</a>), the card is turned face up just before the player announces that they are playing the card (see rule <a href="#cr601.2">601.2</a>).</p>
<p><a id="cr406.3b"><b>406.3b</b></a> Some spells and abilities allow a player to cast spells with certain qualities from among face-down cards in exile. A player may cast such a spell only if they are allowed to look at the face-down card in exile and if the resulting spell has the specified qualities.</p>
<p><a id="cr406.4"><b>406.4.</b></a> Face-down cards in exile should be kept in separate piles based on when they were exiled and how they were exiled. If a player is instructed to choose an exiled card, the player may choose a specific face-down card only if the player is allowed to look at that card. Otherwise, they may choose a pile of face-down exiled cards, and then a card is chosen at random from within that pile. If choosing such a card is part of casting a spell or activating an ability, the chosen card isn’t revealed until after that cost is fully paid. (See rule <a href="#cr601.2i">601.2i</a>.)</p>
<p><a id="cr406.5"><b>406.5.</b></a> Exiled cards that might return to the battlefield or any other zone should be kept in separate piles to keep track of their respective ways of returning. Exiled cards that may have an impact on the game due to their own abilities (such as cards with haunt) or the abilities of the cards that exiled them should likewise be kept in separate piles.</p>
<p><a id="cr406.6"><b>406.6.</b></a> An object may have one ability printed on it that causes one or more cards to be exiled, and another ability that refers either to “the exiled cards” or to cards “exiled with [this object].” These abilities are linked: the second refers only to cards that have been exiled due to the first. See rule <a href="#cr607">607</a>, “Linked Abilities.”</p>
<p><a id="cr406.7"><b>406.7.</b></a> If an object in the exile zone becomes exiled, it doesn’t change zones, but it becomes a new object that has just been exiled.</p>
<p><a id="cr406.8"><b>406.8.</b></a> Previously, the exile zone was called the “removed-from-the-game zone.” Cards that were printed with text that “removes [an object] from the game” exiles that object. The same is true for cards printed with text that “sets [an object] aside.” Cards that were printed with that text have received errata in the Oracle card reference.</p>
<p><a id="cr407"><b>407. Ante</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr407.1"><b>407.1.</b></a> Earlier versions of the Magic rules included an ante rule as a way of playing “for keeps.” Playing Magic games for ante is now considered an optional variation on the game, and it’s allowed only where it’s not forbidden by law or by other rules. Playing for ante is strictly forbidden under the Magic: The Gathering Tournament Rules (WPN.Wizards.com/en/resources/rules-documents).</p>
<p><a id="cr407.2"><b>407.2.</b></a> When playing for ante, each player puts one random card from their deck into the ante zone after determining which player goes first but before players draw any cards. Cards in the ante zone may be examined by any player at any time. At the end of the game, the winner becomes the owner of all the cards in the ante zone.</p>
<p><a id="cr407.3"><b>407.3.</b></a> A few cards have the text “Remove [this card] from your deck before playing if you’re not playing for ante.” These are the only cards that can add or remove cards from the ante zone or change a card’s owner. When not playing for ante, players can’t include these cards in their decks or sideboards, and these cards can’t be brought into the game from outside the game.</p>
<p><a id="cr407.4"><b>407.4.</b></a> To ante an object is to put that object into the ante zone from whichever zone it’s currently in. The owner of an object is the only person who can ante that object.</p>
<p><a id="cr408"><b>408. Command</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr408.1"><b>408.1.</b></a> The command zone is a game area reserved for certain specialized objects that have an overarching effect on the game, yet are not permanents and cannot be destroyed.</p>

<p><a id="cr500.1"><b>500.1.</b></a> A turn consists of five phases, in this order: beginning, precombat main, combat, postcombat main, and ending. Each of these phases takes place every turn, even if nothing happens during the phase. The beginning, combat, and ending phases are further broken down into steps, which proceed in order.</p>
<p><a id="cr500.2"><b>500.2.</b></a> A phase or step in which players receive priority ends when the stack is empty and all players pass in succession. Simply having the stack become empty doesn’t cause such a phase or step to end; all players have to pass in succession with the stack empty. Because of this, each player gets a chance to add new things to the stack before that phase or step ends.</p>
<p><a id="cr500.3"><b>500.3.</b></a> A step in which no players receive priority ends when all specified actions that take place during that step are completed. The only such steps are the untap step (see rule <a href="#cr502">502</a>) and certain cleanup steps (see rule <a href="#cr514">514</a>).</p>
<p><a id="cr500.4"><b>500.4.</b></a> When a step or phase ends, any unused mana left in a player’s mana pool empties. This turn-based action doesn’t use the stack.</p>
<p><a id="cr500.5"><b>500.5.</b></a> When a phase or step ends, any effects scheduled to last “until end of” that phase or step expire. When a phase or step begins, any effects scheduled to last “until” that phase or step expire. Effects that last “until end of combat” expire at the end of the combat phase, not at the beginning of the end of combat step. Effects that last “until end of turn” are subject to special rules; see rule <a href="#cr514.2">514.2</a>.</p>
<p><a id="cr500.6"><b>500.6.</b></a> When a phase or step begins, any abilities that trigger “at the beginning of” that phase or step trigger. They are put on the stack the next time a player would receive priority. (See rule <a href="#cr117">117</a>, “Timing and Priority.”)</p>
<p><a id="cr500.7"><b>500.7.</b></a> Some effects can give a player extra turns. They do this by adding the turns directly after the specified turn. If a player is given multiple extra turns, the extra turns are added one at a time. If multiple players are given extra turns, the extra turns are added one at a time, in APNAP order (see rule <a href="#cr101.4">101.4</a>). The most recently created turn will be taken first.</p>
<p><a id="cr500.8"><b>500.8.</b></a> Some effects can add phases to a turn. They do this by adding the phases directly after the specified phase. If multiple extra phases are created after the same phase, the most recently created phase will occur first.</p>
<p><a id="cr500.9"><b>500.9.</b></a> Some effects can add steps to a phase. They do this by adding the steps directly after a specified step or directly before a specified step. If multiple extra steps are created after the same step, the most recently created step will occur first.</p>
<p><a id="cr500.10"><b>500.10.</b></a> Some effects can cause a step, phase, or turn to be skipped. To skip a step, phase, or turn is to proceed past it as though it didn’t exist. See rule <a href="#cr614.10">614.10</a>.</p>
<p><a id="cr500.11"><b>500.11.</b></a> No game events can occur between turns, phases, or steps.</p>
<p><a id="cr501"><b>501. Beginning Phase</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr501.1"><b>501.1.</b></a> The beginning phase consists of three steps, in this order: untap, upkeep, and draw.</p>
<p><a id="cr502"><b>502. Untap Step</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr502.1"><b>502.1.</b></a> First, all phased-in permanents with phasing that the active player controls phase out, and all phased-out permanents that the active player controlled when they phased out phase in. This all happens simultaneously. This turn-based action doesn’t use the stack. See rule <a href="#cr702.26">702.26</a>, “Phasing.”</p>
<p><a id="cr502.2"><b>502.2.</b></a> Second, if it’s day and the previous turn’s active player didn’t cast any spells during that turn, it becomes night. If it’s night and the previous turn’s active player cast two or more spells during that turn, it becomes day. If it’s neither day nor night, this check doesn’t happen and it remains neither. This turn-based action doesn’t use the stack. See rule <a href="#cr724">724</a>, “Day and Night.”</p>
<p><a id="cr502.2a"><b>502.2a</b></a> Multiplayer games using the shared team turns option use a modified rule. If it’s day and no player on the previous turn’s active team cast a spell during that turn, it becomes night. If it’s night and any player on the previous turn’s active team cast two or more spells during the previous turn, it becomes day. If it’s neither day nor night, this check doesn’t happen and it remains neither. This turn-based action doesn’t use the stack.</p>
<p><a id="cr502.3"><b>502.3.</b></a> Third, the active player determines which permanents they control will untap. Then they untap them all simultaneously. This turn-based action doesn’t use the stack. Normally, all of a player’s permanents untap, but effects can keep one or more of a player’s permanents from untapping.</p>
<p><a id="cr502.4"><b>502.4.</b></a> No player receives priority during the untap step, so no spells can be cast or resolve and no abilities can be activated or resolve. Any ability that triggers during this step will be held until the next time a player would receive priority, which is usually during the upkeep step. (See rule <a href="#cr503">503</a>, “Upkeep Step.”)</p>
<p><a id="cr503"><b>503. Upkeep Step</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr503.1"><b>503.1.</b></a> The upkeep step has no turn-based actions. Once it begins, the active player gets priority. (See rule <a href="#cr117">117</a>, “Timing and Priority.”)</p>
<p><a id="cr503.1a"><b>503.1a</b></a> Any abilities that triggered during the untap step and any abilities that triggered at the beginning of the upkeep are put onto the stack before the active player gets priority; the order in which they triggered doesn’t matter. (See rule <a href="#cr603">603</a>, “Handling Triggered Abilities.”)</p>
<p><a id="cr503.2"><b>503.2.</b></a> If a spell states that it may be cast only “after [a player’s] upkeep step,” and the turn has multiple upkeep steps, that spell may be cast any time after the first upkeep step ends.</p>
<p><a id="cr504"><b>504. Draw Step</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr504.1"><b>504.1.</b></a> First, the active player draws a card. This turn-based action doesn’t use the stack.</p>
<p><a id="cr504.2"><b>504.2.</b></a> Second, the active player gets priority. (See rule <a href="#cr117">117</a>, “Timing and Priority.”)</p>
<p><a id="cr505"><b>505. Main Phase</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr505.1"><b>505.1.</b></a> There are two main phases in a turn. In each turn, the first main phase (also known as the precombat main phase) and the second main phase (also known as the postcombat main phase) are separated by the combat phase (see rule <a href="#cr506">506</a>, “Combat Phase”). The precombat and postcombat main phases are individually and collectively known as the main phase.</p>
<p><a id="cr505.1a"><b>505.1a</b></a> Only the first main phase of the turn is a precombat main phase. All other main phases are postcombat main phases. This includes the second main phase of a turn in which the combat phase has been skipped. It is also true of a turn in which an effect has caused an additional combat phase and an additional main phase to be created.</p>
<p><a id="cr505.2"><b>505.2.</b></a> The main phase has no steps, so a main phase ends when all players pass in succession while the stack is empty. (See rule <a href="#cr500.2">500.2</a>.)</p>
<p><a id="cr505.3"><b>505.3.</b></a> First, but only if the players are playing an Archenemy game (see rule <a href="#cr904">904</a>), the active player is the archenemy, and it’s the active player’s precombat main phase, the active player sets the top card of their scheme deck in motion (see rule <a href="#cr701.25">701.25</a>). This turn-based action doesn’t use the stack.</p>
<p><a id="cr505.4"><b>505.4.</b></a> Second, if the active player controls one or more Saga enchantments and it’s the active player’s precombat main phase, the active player puts a lore counter on each Saga they control. (See rule <a href="#cr715">715</a>, “Saga Cards.”) This turn-based action doesn’t use the stack.</p>
<p><a id="cr505.5"><b>505.5.</b></a> Third, the active player gets priority. (See rule <a href="#cr117">117</a>, “Timing and Priority.”)</p>
<p><a id="cr505.5a"><b>505.5a</b></a> The main phase is the only phase in which a player can normally cast artifact, creature, enchantment, planeswalker, and sorcery spells. The active player may cast these spells.</p>
<p><a id="cr505.5b"><b>505.5b</b></a> During either main phase, the active player may play one land card from their hand if the stack is empty, if the player has priority, and if they haven’t played a land this turn (unless an effect states the player may play additional lands). This action doesn’t use the stack. Neither the land nor the action of playing the land is a spell or ability, so it can’t be countered, and players can’t respond to it with instants or activated abilities. (See rule <a href="#cr305">305</a>, “Lands.”)</p>
<p><a id="cr506"><b>506. Combat Phase</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr506.1"><b>506.1.</b></a> The combat phase has five steps, which proceed in order: beginning of combat, declare attackers, declare blockers, combat damage, and end of combat. The declare blockers and combat damage steps are skipped if no creatures are declared as attackers or put onto the battlefield attacking (see rule <a href="#cr508.8">508.8</a>). There are two combat damage steps if any attacking or blocking creature has first strike (see rule <a href="#cr702.7">702.7</a>) or double strike (see rule <a href="#cr702.4">702.4</a>).</p>
<p><a id="cr506.2"><b>506.2.</b></a> During the combat phase, the active player is the attacking player; creatures that player controls may attack. During the combat phase of a two-player game, the nonactive player is the defending player; that player and planeswalkers they control may be attacked.</p>
<p><a id="cr506.2a"><b>506.2a</b></a> During the combat phase of a multiplayer game, there may be one or more defending players, depending on the variant being played and the options chosen for it. Unless all the attacking player’s opponents automatically become defending players during the combat phase, the attacking player chooses one of their opponents as a turn-based action during the beginning of combat step. (Note that the choice may be dictated by the variant being played or the options chosen for it.) That player becomes the defending player. See rule <a href="#cr802">802</a>, “Attack Multiple Players Option,” rule <a href="#cr803">803</a>, “Attack Left and Attack Right Options,” and rule <a href="#cr809">809</a>, “Emperor Variant.”</p>
<p><a id="cr506.2b"><b>506.2b</b></a> In multiplayer games using the shared team turns option, the active team is the attacking team and the nonactive team is the defending team. See rule <a href="#cr805">805</a>, “Shared Team Turns Option.”</p>
<p><a id="cr506.3"><b>506.3.</b></a> Only a creature can attack or block. Only a player or a planeswalker can be attacked.</p>
<p><a id="cr506.3a"><b>506.3a</b></a> If an effect would put a noncreature permanent onto the battlefield attacking or blocking, the permanent does enter the battlefield but it’s never considered to be an attacking or blocking permanent.</p>
<p><a id="cr506.3b"><b>506.3b</b></a> If an effect would put a creature onto the battlefield attacking under the control of any player except an attacking player, that creature does enter the battlefield, but it’s never considered to be an attacking creature.</p>
<p><a id="cr506.3c"><b>506.3c</b></a> If an effect would put a creature onto the battlefield attacking either a player not in the game or a planeswalker no longer on the battlefield or no longer a planeswalker, that creature does enter the battlefield, but it’s never considered to be an attacking creature.</p>
<p><a id="cr506.3d"><b>506.3d</b></a> If an effect would put a creature onto the battlefield blocking but the creature it would block isn’t attacking either the first creature’s controller or a planeswalker that player controls, that creature does enter the battlefield, but it’s never considered to be a blocking creature.</p>
<p><a id="cr506.4"><b>506.4.</b></a> A permanent is removed from combat if it leaves the battlefield, if its controller changes, if it phases out, if an effect specifically removes it from combat, if it’s a planeswalker that’s being attacked and stops being a planeswalker, or if it’s an attacking or blocking creature that regenerates (see rule <a href="#cr701.15">701.15</a>) or stops being a creature. A creature that’s removed from combat stops being an attacking, blocking, blocked, and/or unblocked creature. A planeswalker that’s removed from combat stops being attacked.</p>
<p><a id="cr506.4a"><b>506.4a</b></a> Once a creature has been declared as an attacking or blocking creature, spells or abilities that would have kept that creature from attacking or blocking don’t remove the creature from combat.</p>
<p><a id="cr506.4b"><b>506.4b</b></a> Tapping or untapping a creature that’s already been declared as an attacker or blocker doesn’t remove it from combat and doesn’t prevent its combat damage.</p>
<p><a id="cr506.4c"><b>506.4c</b></a> If a creature is attacking a planeswalker, removing that planeswalker from combat doesn’t remove that creature from combat. It continues to be an attacking creature, although it is attacking neither a player nor a planeswalker. It may be blocked. If it is unblocked, it will deal no combat damage.</p>
<p><a id="cr506.4d"><b>506.4d</b></a> A permanent that’s both a blocking creature and a planeswalker that’s being attacked is removed from combat if it stops being both a creature and a planeswalker. If it stops being one of those card types but continues to be the other, it continues to be either a blocking creature or a planeswalker that’s being attacked, whichever is appropriate.</p>
<p><a id="cr506.5"><b>506.5.</b></a> A creature attacks alone if it’s the only creature declared as an attacker during the declare attackers step. A creature is attacking alone if it’s attacking but no other creatures are. A creature blocks alone if it’s the only creature declared as a blocker during the declare blockers step. A creature is blocking alone if it’s blocking but no other creatures are.</p>
<p><a id="cr506.6"><b>506.6.</b></a> Some spells state that they may be cast “only [before/after] [a particular point in the combat phase],” in which that point may be “attackers are declared,” “blockers are declared,” “the combat damage step,” “the end of combat step,” “the combat phase,” or “combat.”</p>
<p><a id="cr506.6a"><b>506.6a</b></a> A spell that states it may be cast “only before (or after) attackers are declared” is referring to the turn-based action of declaring attackers. It may be cast only before (or after) the declare attackers step begins, regardless of whether any attackers are actually declared. (See rule <a href="#cr508.">508.</a>)</p>
<p><a id="cr506.6b"><b>506.6b</b></a> A spell that states it may be cast “only before (or after) blockers are declared” is referring to the turn-based action of declaring blockers. It may be cast only before (or after) the declare blockers step begins, regardless of whether any blockers are actually declared. (See rule <a href="#cr509.">509.</a>)</p>
<p><a id="cr506.6c"><b>506.6c</b></a> Some spells state that they may be cast only “during combat” or “during a certain player’s combat phase” in addition to the criteria described in rule <a href="#cr506.6">506.6</a>. If a turn has multiple combat phases, such spells may be cast at an appropriate time during any of them.</p>
<p><a id="cr506.6d"><b>506.6d</b></a> Some spells state that they may be cast “only before (or after) [a particular point in the combat phase],” but don’t meet the additional criteria described in rule <a href="#cr506.6c">506.6c</a>. If a turn has multiple combat phases, such spells may be cast that turn only before (or after) the stated point of the first combat phase.</p>
<p><a id="cr506.6e"><b>506.6e</b></a> If a spell states that it may be cast “only before [a particular point in the combat phase],” but the stated point doesn’t exist within the relevant combat phase because the declare blockers step and the combat damage step are skipped (see rule <a href="#cr508.8">508.8</a>), then the spell may be cast only before the declare attackers step ends. If the stated point doesn’t exist because the relevant combat phase has been skipped, then the spell may be cast only before the precombat main phase ends.</p>
<p><a id="cr506.6f"><b>506.6f</b></a> If a spell states that it may be cast “only during combat after blockers are declared,” but the declare blockers step is skipped that combat phase (see rule <a href="#cr508.8">508.8</a>), then the spell may not be cast during that combat phase.</p>
<p><a id="cr506.6g"><b>506.6g</b></a> Rules 506.6 and <a href="#cr506.6a">506.6a</a>–f apply to abilities that state that they may be activated only at certain times with respect to combat just as they apply to spells that state that they may be cast only at certain times with respect to combat.</p>
<p><a id="cr507"><b>507. Beginning of Combat Step</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr507.1"><b>507.1.</b></a> First, if the game being played is a multiplayer game in which the active player’s opponents don’t all automatically become defending players, the active player chooses one of their opponents. That player becomes the defending player. This turn-based action doesn’t use the stack. (See rule <a href="#cr506.2">506.2</a>.)</p>
<p><a id="cr507.2"><b>507.2.</b></a> Second, the active player gets priority. (See rule <a href="#cr117">117</a>, “Timing and Priority.”)</p>
<p><a id="cr508"><b>508. Declare Attackers Step</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr508.1"><b>508.1.</b></a> First, the active player declares attackers. This turn-based action doesn’t use the stack. To declare attackers, the active player follows the steps below, in order. If at any point during the declaration of attackers, the active player is unable to comply with any of the steps listed below, the declaration is illegal; the game returns to the moment before the declaration (see rule <a href="#cr726">726</a>, “Handling Illegal Actions”).</p>
<p><a id="cr508.1a"><b>508.1a</b></a> The active player chooses which creatures that they control, if any, will attack. The chosen creatures must be untapped, and each one must either have haste or have been controlled by the active player continuously since the turn began.</p>
<p><a id="cr508.1b"><b>508.1b</b></a> If the defending player controls any planeswalkers, or the game allows the active player to attack multiple other players, the active player announces which player or planeswalker each of the chosen creatures is attacking.</p>
<p><a id="cr508.1c"><b>508.1c</b></a> The active player checks each creature they control to see whether it’s affected by any restrictions (effects that say a creature can’t attack, or that it can’t attack unless some condition is met). If any restrictions are being disobeyed, the declaration of attackers is illegal.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> A player controls two creatures, each with a restriction that states “[This creature] can’t attack alone.” It’s legal to declare both as attackers.</p>
<p><a id="cr508.1d"><b>508.1d</b></a> The active player checks each creature they control to see whether it’s affected by any requirements (effects that say a creature attacks if able, or that it attacks if some condition is met). If the number of requirements that are being obeyed is fewer than the maximum possible number of requirements that could be obeyed without disobeying any restrictions, the declaration of attackers is illegal. If a creature can’t attack unless a player pays a cost, that player is not required to pay that cost, even if attacking with that creature would increase the number of requirements being obeyed. If a requirement that says a creature attacks if able during a certain turn refers to a turn with multiple combat phases, the creature attacks if able during each declare attackers step in that turn.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> A player controls two creatures: one that “attacks if able” and one with no abilities. An effect states “No more than one creature can attack each turn.” The only legal attack is for just the creature that “attacks if able” to attack. It’s illegal to attack with the other creature, attack with both, or attack with neither.</p>
<p><a id="cr508.1e"><b>508.1e</b></a> If any of the chosen creatures have banding or a “bands with other” ability, the active player announces which creatures, if any, are banded with which. (See rule <a href="#cr702.22">702.22</a>, “Banding.”)</p>
<p><a id="cr508.1f"><b>508.1f</b></a> The active player taps the chosen creatures. Tapping a creature when it’s declared as an attacker isn’t a cost; attacking simply causes creatures to become tapped.</p>
<p><a id="cr508.1g"><b>508.1g</b></a> If there are any optional costs to attack with the chosen creatures (expressed as costs a player may pay “as” a creature attacks), the active player chooses which, if any, they will pay.</p>
<p><a id="cr508.1h"><b>508.1h</b></a> If any of the chosen creatures require paying costs to attack, or if any optional costs to attack were chosen, the active player determines the total cost to attack. Costs may include paying mana, tapping permanents, sacrificing permanents, discarding cards, and so on. Once the total cost is determined, it becomes “locked in.” If effects would change the total cost after this time, ignore this change.</p>
<p><a id="cr508.1i"><b>508.1i</b></a> If any of the costs require mana, the active player then has a chance to activate mana abilities (see rule <a href="#cr605">605</a>, “Mana Abilities”).</p>
<p><a id="cr508.1j"><b>508.1j</b></a> Once the player has enough mana in their mana pool, they pay all costs in any order. Partial payments are not allowed.</p>
<p><a id="cr508.1k"><b>508.1k</b></a> Each chosen creature still controlled by the active player becomes an attacking creature. It remains an attacking creature until it’s removed from combat or the combat phase ends, whichever comes first. See rule <a href="#cr506.4">506.4</a>.</p>
<p><a id="cr508.1m"><b>508.1m</b></a> Any abilities that trigger on attackers being declared trigger.</p>
<p><a id="cr508.2"><b>508.2.</b></a> Second, the active player gets priority. (See rule <a href="#cr117">117</a>, “Timing and Priority.”)</p>
<p><a id="cr508.2a"><b>508.2a</b></a> Abilities that trigger on a creature attacking trigger only at the point the creature is declared as an attacker. They will not trigger if a creature attacks and then that creature’s characteristics change to match the ability’s trigger condition.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> A permanent has the ability “Whenever a green creature attacks, destroy that creature at end of combat.” If a blue creature attacks and is later turned green, the ability will not trigger.</p>
<p><a id="cr508.2b"><b>508.2b</b></a> Any abilities that triggered on attackers being declared or that triggered during the process described in rules <a href="#cr508.1">508.1</a> are put onto the stack before the active player gets priority; the order in which they triggered doesn’t matter. (See rule <a href="#cr603">603</a>, “Handling Triggered Abilities.”)</p>
<p><a id="cr508.3"><b>508.3.</b></a> Triggered abilities that trigger on attackers being declared may have different trigger conditions.</p>
<p><a id="cr508.3a"><b>508.3a</b></a> An ability that reads “Whenever [a creature] attacks, . . .” triggers if that creature is declared as an attacker. Similarly, “Whenever [a creature] attacks [a player or planeswalker], . . .” triggers if that creature is declared as an attacker attacking that player or planeswalker. Such abilities won’t trigger if a creature is put onto the battlefield attacking.</p>
<p><a id="cr508.3b"><b>508.3b</b></a> An ability that reads “Whenever [a player or planeswalker] is attacked, . . .” triggers if one or more creatures are declared as attackers attacking that player or planeswalker. It won’t trigger if a creature is put onto the battlefield attacking that player or planeswalker.</p>
<p><a id="cr508.3c"><b>508.3c</b></a> An ability that reads “Whenever [a player] attacks with [a creature], . . .” triggers if a creature that player controls is declared as an attacker.</p>
<p><a id="cr508.3d"><b>508.3d</b></a> An ability that reads “Whenever [a player] attacks, . . .” triggers if one or more creatures that player controls are declared as attackers.</p>
<p><a id="cr508.3e"><b>508.3e</b></a> An ability that reads “Whenever [a player] attacks [another player], . . .” triggers if one or more creatures the first player controls are declared as attackers attacking the second player. It won’t trigger if a creature is put onto the battlefield attacking or if a creature attacks a planeswalker.</p>
<p><a id="cr508.3f"><b>508.3f</b></a> An ability that reads “Whenever [a creature] attacks and isn’t blocked, . . .” triggers during the declare blockers step, not the declare attackers step. See rule <a href="#cr509.5g">509.5g</a>.</p>
<p><a id="cr508.4"><b>508.4.</b></a> If a creature is put onto the battlefield attacking, its controller chooses which defending player or which planeswalker a defending player controls it’s attacking as it enters the battlefield (unless the effect that put it onto the battlefield specifies what it’s attacking). Similarly, if an effect states that a creature is attacking, its controller chooses which defending player or which planeswalker a defending player controls it’s attacking it becomes attacking (unless the effect has already specified). Such creatures are “attacking” but, for the purposes of trigger events and effects, they never “attacked.”</p>
<p><a id="cr508.4a"><b>508.4a</b></a> If the effect that puts a creature onto the battlefield attacking specifies it’s attacking a certain player, and that player is no longer in the game when the effect resolves, the creature is put onto the battlefield but is never considered an attacking creature. The same is true if the effect specifies a creature is put onto the battlefield attacking a planeswalker and that planeswalker is no longer on the battlefield or is no longer a planeswalker when the effect resolves.</p>

<p><a id="cr509.1"><b>509.1.</b></a> First, the defending player declares blockers. This turn-based action doesn’t use the stack. To declare blockers, the defending player follows the steps below, in order. If at any point during the declaration of blockers, the defending player is unable to comply with any of the steps listed below, the declaration is illegal; the game returns to the moment before the declaration (see rule <a href="#cr726">726</a>, “Handling Illegal Actions”).</p>
<p><a id="cr509.1a"><b>509.1a</b></a> The defending player chooses which creatures they control, if any, will block. The chosen creatures must be untapped. For each of the chosen creatures, the defending player chooses one creature for it to block that’s attacking that player or a planeswalker they control.</p>
<p><a id="cr509.1b"><b>509.1b</b></a> The defending player checks each creature they control to see whether it’s affected by any restrictions (effects that say a creature can’t block, or that it can’t block unless some condition is met). If any restrictions are being disobeyed, the declaration of blockers is illegal.</p>
<p><a id="cr509.1c"><b>509.1c</b></a> The defending player checks each creature they control to see whether it’s affected by any requirements (effects that say a creature must block, or that it must block if some condition is met). If the number of requirements that are being obeyed is fewer than the maximum possible number of requirements that could be obeyed without disobeying any restrictions, the declaration of blockers is illegal. If a creature can’t block unless a player pays a cost, that player is not required to pay that cost, even if blocking with that creature would increase the number of requirements being obeyed. If a requirement that says a creature blocks if able during a certain turn refers to a turn with multiple combat phases, the creature blocks if able during each declare blockers step in that turn.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> A player controls one creature that “blocks if able” and another creature with no abilities. If a creature with menace attacks that player, the player must block with both creatures. Having only the first creature block violates the restriction created by menace (the attacking creature can’t be blocked except by two or more creatures). Having only the second creature block violates both the menace restriction and the first creature’s blocking requirement. Having neither creature block fulfills the restriction but not the requirement.</p>
<p><a id="cr509.1d"><b>509.1d</b></a> If any of the chosen creatures require paying costs to block, the defending player determines the total cost to block. Costs may include paying mana, tapping permanents, sacrificing permanents, discarding cards, and so on. Once the total cost is determined, it becomes “locked in.” If effects would change the total cost after this time, ignore this change.</p>
<p><a id="cr509.1e"><b>509.1e</b></a> If any of the costs require mana, the defending player then has a chance to activate mana abilities (see rule <a href="#cr605">605</a>, “Mana Abilities”).</p>
<p><a id="cr509.1f"><b>509.1f</b></a> Once the player has enough mana in their mana pool, they pay all costs in any order. Partial payments are not allowed.</p>
<p><a id="cr509.1g"><b>509.1g</b></a> Each chosen creature still controlled by the defending player becomes a blocking creature. Each one is blocking the attacking creatures chosen for it.

<p><a id="cr509.1h"><b>509.1h</b></a> An attacking creature with one or more creatures declared as blockers for it becomes a blocked creature; one with no creatures declared as blockers for it becomes an unblocked creature.

A creature remains blocked even if all the creatures blocking it are removed from combat.</p>

<p><a id="cr509.5b"><b>509.5b</b></a> An ability that reads “Whenever [a creature] blocks a creature, . . .” triggers once for each attacking creature the creature with the ability blocks.

It will also trigger if an effect causes that creature to block an attacking creature, but only if it wasn’t already blocking that attacking creature at that time. It won’t trigger if the creature is put onto the battlefield blocking.</p>
<p><a id="cr509.5c"><b>509.5c</b></a> An ability that reads “Whenever [a creature] becomes blocked, . . .” generally triggers only once each combat for that creature, even if it’s blocked by multiple creatures. It will trigger if that creature becomes blocked by at least one creature declared as a blocker. It will also trigger if that creature becomes blocked by an effect or by a creature that’s put onto the battlefield as a blocker, but only if the attacking creature was an unblocked creature at that time. (See rule <a href="#cr509.1h">509.1h</a>.)</p>
<p><a id="cr509.5d"><b>509.5d</b></a> An ability that reads “Whenever [a creature] becomes blocked by a creature, . . .” triggers once for each creature that blocks the named creature. It triggers if a creature is declared as a blocker for the attacking creature. It will also trigger if an effect causes a creature to block the attacking creature, but only if it wasn’t already blocking that attacking creature at that time. In addition, it will trigger if a creature is put onto the battlefield blocking that creature. It won’t trigger if the creature becomes blocked by an effect rather than a creature.</p>
<p><a id="cr509.5e"><b>509.5e</b></a> If an ability triggers when a creature blocks or becomes blocked by a particular number of creatures, the ability triggers if the creature blocks or is blocked by that many creatures when blockers are declared. Effects that add or remove blockers can also cause such abilities to trigger. This applies to abilities that trigger on a creature blocking or being blocked by at least a certain number of creatures as well.</p>
<p><a id="cr509.5f"><b>509.5f</b></a> If an ability triggers when a creature with certain characteristics blocks, it will trigger only if the creature has those characteristics at the point blockers are declared, or at the point an effect causes it to block. If an ability triggers when a creature with certain characteristics becomes blocked, it will trigger only if the creature has those characteristics at the point it becomes a blocked creature. If an ability triggers when a creature becomes blocked by a creature with certain characteristics, it will trigger only if the latter creature has those characteristics at the point it becomes a blocking creature. None of those abilities will trigger if the relevant creature’s characteristics change to match the ability’s trigger condition later on.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> A creature has the ability “Whenever this creature becomes blocked by a white creature, destroy that creature at end of combat.” If the creature becomes blocked by a black creature that is later turned white, the ability will not trigger.</p>
<p><a id="cr509.5g"><b>509.5g</b></a> An ability that reads “Whenever [a creature] attacks and isn’t blocked, . . .” triggers if no creatures are declared as blockers for that creature. It will trigger even if the creature was never declared as an attacker (for example, if it entered the battlefield attacking). It won’t trigger if the attacking creature is blocked and then all its blockers are removed from combat.</p>
<p><a id="cr509.6"><b>509.6.</b></a> If a spell or ability causes a creature on the battlefield to block an attacking creature, the active player announces the blocking creature’s placement in the attacking creature’s damage assignment order. The relative order among the remaining blocking creatures is unchanged. Then the defending player announces the attacking creature’s placement in the blocking creature’s damage assignment order. The relative order among the remaining attacking creatures is unchanged. This is done as part of the blocking effect.</p>
<p><a id="cr509.7"><b>509.7.</b></a> If a creature is put onto the battlefield blocking, its controller chooses which attacking creature it’s blocking as it enters the battlefield (unless the effect that put it onto the battlefield specifies what it’s blocking), then the active player announces the new creature’s placement in the blocked creature’s damage assignment order. The relative order among the remaining blocking creatures is unchanged. A creature put onto the battlefield this way is “blocking” but, for the purposes of trigger events and effects, it never “blocked.”<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Giant Spider is blocked by Canyon Minotaur. The defending player casts Flash Foliage, which creates a Saproling creature token blocking the Giant Spider. Giant Spider’s controller announces the Giant Spider’s damage assignment order as the Saproling token, then Canyon Minotaur.</p>
<p><a id="cr509.7a"><b>509.7a</b></a> If the effect that puts a creature onto the battlefield blocking specifies it’s blocking a certain creature and that creature is no longer attacking, the creature is put onto the battlefield but is never considered a blocking creature.

<p><a id="cr509.7b"><b>509.7b</b></a> A creature that’s put onto the battlefield blocking isn’t affected by requirements or restrictions that apply to the declaration of blockers.</p>
<p><a id="cr510"><b>510. Combat Damage Step</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr510.1"><b>510.1.</b></a> First, the active player announces how each attacking creature assigns its combat damage, then the defending player announces how each blocking creature assigns its combat damage. This turn-based action doesn’t use the stack. A player assigns a creature’s combat damage according to the following rules:</p>
<p><a id="cr510.1a"><b>510.1a</b></a> Each attacking creature and each blocking creature assigns combat damage equal to its power. Creatures that would assign 0 or less damage this way don’t assign combat damage at all.</p>
<p><a id="cr510.1b"><b>510.1b</b></a> An unblocked creature assigns its combat damage to the player or planeswalker it’s attacking. If it isn’t currently attacking anything (if, for example, it was attacking a planeswalker that has left the battlefield), it assigns no combat damage.</p>
<p><a id="cr510.1c"><b>510.1c</b></a> A blocked creature assigns its combat damage to the creatures blocking it. If no creatures are currently blocking it (if, for example, they were destroyed or removed from combat), it assigns no combat damage. If exactly one creature is blocking it, it assigns all its combat damage to that creature. If two or more creatures are blocking it, it assigns its combat damage to those creatures according to the damage assignment order announced for it. This may allow the blocked creature to divide its combat damage. However, it can’t assign combat damage to a creature that’s blocking it unless, when combat damage assignments are complete, each creature that precedes that blocking creature in its order is assigned lethal damage. When checking for assigned lethal damage, take into account damage already marked on the creature and damage from other creatures that’s being assigned during the same combat damage step, but not any abilities or effects that might change the amount of damage that’s actually dealt. An amount of damage that’s greater than a creature’s lethal damage may be assigned to it.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> The damage assignment order of an attacking Vastwood Gorger (a 5/6 creature) is Pride Guardian (a 0/3 creature) then Llanowar Elves (a 1/1 creature).

Vastwood Gorger must assign its 5 damage to the Guardian.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> The damage assignment order of an attacking Vastwood Gorger (a 5/6 creature) is Pride Guardian (a 0/3 creature) then Llanowar Elves (a 1/1 creature). During the declare blockers step, the defending player casts Mending Hands targeting Pride Guardian, which prevents the next 4 damage that would be dealt to it. Vastwood Gorger can assign 3 damage to the Guardian and 2 damage to the Elves, 4 damage to the Guardian and 1 damage to the Elves, or 5 damage to the Guardian.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> The damage assignment order of an attacking Enormous Baloth (a 7/7 creature) is Trained Armodon (a 3/3 creature) that already has 2 damage marked on it, then Foriysian Brigade (a 2/4 creature that can block an additional creature), then Silverback Ape (a 5/5 creature). The damage assignment order of an attacking Durkwood Boars (a 4/4 creature) is the same Foriysian Brigade, then Goblin Piker (a 2/1 creature). Among other possibilities, the active player may have the Baloth assign 1 damage to the Armodon, 1 damage to the Brigade, and 5 damage to the Ape, and have the Boars assign 3 damage to the Brigade and 1 damage to the Piker.</p>
<p><a id="cr510.1d"><b>510.1d</b></a> A blocking creature assigns combat damage to the creatures it’s blocking. If it isn’t currently blocking any creatures (if, for example, they were destroyed or removed from combat), it assigns no combat damage. If it’s blocking exactly one creature, it assigns all its combat damage to that creature. If it’s blocking two or more creatures, it assigns its combat damage to those creatures according to the damage assignment order announced for it. This may allow the blocking creature to divide its combat damage. However, it can’t assign combat damage to a creature that it’s blocking unless, when combat damage assignments are complete, each creature that precedes that blocked creature is assigned lethal damage. When checking for assigned lethal damage, take into account damage already marked on the creature and damage from other creatures that’s being assigned during the same combat damage step, but not any abilities or effects that might change the amount of damage that’s actually dealt. An amount of damage that’s greater than a creature’s lethal damage may be assigned to it.</p>
<p><a id="cr510.1e"><b>510.1e</b></a> Once a player has assigned combat damage from each attacking or blocking creature they control, the total damage assignment (not solely the damage assignment of any individual attacking or blocking creature) is checked to see if it complies with the above rules. If it doesn’t, the combat damage assignment is illegal; the game returns to the moment before that player began to assign combat damage. (See rule <a href="#cr726">726</a>, “Handling Illegal Actions.”)</p>
<p><a id="cr510.2"><b>510.2.</b></a> Second, all combat damage that’s been assigned is dealt simultaneously. This turn-based action doesn’t use the stack. No player has the chance to cast spells or activate abilities between the time combat damage is assigned and the time it’s dealt.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Squadron Hawk (a 1/1 creature with flying) and Goblin Piker (a 2/1 creature) are attacking. Mogg Fanatic (a 1/1 creature with the ability “Sacrifice Mogg Fanatic: Mogg Fanatic deals 1 damage to any target.”) blocks the Goblin Piker. The defending player sacrifices Mogg Fanatic during the declare blockers step to deal 1 damage to the Squadron Hawk. The Hawk is destroyed. The Piker deals and is dealt no combat damage this turn. If the defending player instead left Mogg Fanatic on the battlefield, the Fanatic and the Piker would have dealt lethal damage to one another, but the Squadron Hawk couldn’t have been dealt damage.</p>
<p><a id="cr510.3"><b>510.3.</b></a> Third, the active player gets priority. (See rule <a href="#cr117">117</a>, “Timing and Priority.”)</p>
<p><a id="cr510.3a"><b>510.3a</b></a> Any abilities that triggered on damage being dealt or while state-based actions are performed afterward are put onto the stack before the active player gets priority; the order in which they triggered doesn’t matter.

<p><a id="cr510.4"><b>510.4.</b></a> If at least one attacking or blocking creature has first strike (see rule <a href="#cr702.7">702.7</a>) or double strike (see rule <a href="#cr702.4">702.4</a>) as the combat damage step begins, the only creatures that assign combat damage in that step are those with first strike or double strike. After that step, instead of proceeding to the end of combat step, the phase gets a second combat damage step. The only creatures that assign combat damage in that step are the remaining attackers and blockers that had neither first strike nor double strike as the first combat damage step began, as well as the remaining attackers and blockers that currently have double strike. After that step, the phase proceeds to the end of combat step.</p>
<p><a id="cr511"><b>511. End of Combat Step</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr511.1"><b>511.1.</b></a> The end of combat step has no turn-based actions. Once it begins, the active player gets priority. (See rule <a href="#cr117">117</a>, “Timing and Priority.”)</p>
<p><a id="cr511.2"><b>511.2.</b></a> Abilities that trigger “at end of combat” trigger as the end of combat step begins. Effects that last “until end of combat” expire at the end of the combat phase.</p>

<p><a id="cr513.2"><b>513.2.</b></a> If a permanent with an ability that triggers “at the beginning of the end step” enters the battlefield during this step, that ability won’t trigger until the next turn’s end step.

<p><a id="cr514.1"><b>514.1.</b></a> First, if the active player’s hand contains more cards than their maximum hand size (normally seven), they discard enough cards to reduce their hand size to that number. This turn-based action doesn’t use the stack.</p>

<p><a id="cr514.3"><b>514.3.</b></a> Normally, no player receives priority during the cleanup step, so no spells can be cast and no abilities can be activated. However, this rule is subject to the following exception:</p>

<p><a id="cr601.1"><b>601.1.</b></a> Previously, the action of casting a spell, or casting a card as a spell, was referred to on cards as “playing” that spell or that card. Cards that were printed with that text have received errata in the Oracle card reference so they now refer to “casting” that spell or that card.</p>
<p><a id="cr601.1a"><b>601.1a</b></a> Some effects still refer to “playing” a card. “Playing a card” means playing that card as a land or casting that card as a spell, whichever is appropriate.</p>
<p><a id="cr601.2"><b>601.2.</b></a> To cast a spell is to take it from where it is (usually the hand), put it on the stack, and pay its costs, so that it will eventually resolve and have its effect. Casting a spell includes proposal of the spell (rules <a href="#cr601.2a">601.2a</a>–d) and determination and payment of costs (rules <a href="#cr601.2f">601.2f</a>–h). To cast a spell, a player follows the steps listed below, in order. A player must be legally allowed to cast the spell to begin this process (see rule <a href="#cr601.3">601.3</a>). If a player is unable to comply with the requirements of a step listed below while performing that step, the casting of the spell is illegal ; the game returns to the moment before the casting of that spell was proposed (see rule <a href="#cr726">726</a>, “Handling Illegal Actions”).</p>
<p><a id="cr601.2a"><b>601.2a</b></a> To propose the casting of a spell, a player first moves that card (or that copy of a card) from where it is to the stack. It becomes the topmost object on the stack. It has all the characteristics of the card (or the copy of a card) associated with it, and that player becomes its controller. The spell remains on the stack until it resolves, it’s countered, or a rule or effect moves it elsewhere.</p>
<p><b>★</b> <a id="cr601.2b"><b>601.2b</b></a> If the spell is modal, the player announces the mode choice (see rule <a href="#cr700.2">700.2</a>). If the number of choices has a currently undefined value, such as “Choose X,” or a value that may change during the process of casting the spell, such as “If this spell was kicked, choose any number instead”, the player chooses any number of modes. When the spell's legality is checked (rule <a href="#cr601.2e">601.2e</a>), if the value is still undefined or the value does not match the choices made, the spell is illegal. If the player wishes to splice any cards onto the spell (see rule <a href="#cr702.46">702.46</a>), they reveal those cards in their hand. If the spell has alternative or additional costs that will be paid as it's being cast such as buyback or kicker costs (see rules <a href="#cr118.8">118.8</a> and <a href="#cr118.9">118.9</a>), the player announces their intentions to pay any or all of those costs (see rule <a href="#cr601.2f">601.2f</a>). A player can't apply two alternative methods of casting or two alternative costs to a single spell. If the spell has a variable cost that will be paid as it's being cast (such as an {X} in its mana cost; see rule <a href="#cr107.3">107.3</a>), the player announces the value of that variable. If the value of that variable is defined in the text of the spell by a choice that player would make later in the announcement or resolution of the spell, that player makes that choice at this time instead of that later time. If a cost that will be paid as the spell is being cast includes hybrid mana symbols, the player announces the nonhybrid equivalent cost they intend to pay. If a cost that will be paid as the spell is being cast includes Phyrexian mana symbols, the player announces whether they intend to pay 2 life or the corresponding colored mana cost for each of those symbols. Previously made choices (such as choosing to cast a spell with flashback from a graveyard or choosing to cast a creature with morph face down) may restrict the player's options when making these choices.</p>
<p><a id="cr601.2c"><b>601.2c</b></a> The player announces their choice of an appropriate object or player for each target the spell requires. A spell may require some targets only if an alternative or additional cost (such as a kicker cost) or a particular mode was chosen for it; otherwise, the spell is cast as though it did not require those targets. Similarly, a spell may require alternative targets only if an alternative or additional cost was chosen for it. If the spell has a variable number of targets, the player announces how many targets they will choose before they announce those targets. In some cases, the number of targets will be defined by the spell’s text. Once the number of targets the spell has is determined, that number doesn’t change, even if the information used to determine the number of targets does. The same target can’t be chosen multiple times for any one instance of the word “target” on the spell. However, if the spell uses the word “target” in multiple places, the same object or player can be chosen once for each instance of the word “target” (as long as it fits the targeting criteria). If any effects say that an object or player must be chosen as a target, the player chooses targets so that they obey the maximum possible number of such effects without violating any rules or effects that say that an object or player can’t be chosen as a target. The chosen objects and/or players each become a target of that spell. (Any abilities that trigger when those objects and/or players become the target of a spell trigger at this point; they’ll wait to be put on the stack until the spell has finished being cast.)<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> If a spell says “Tap two target creatures,” then the same creature can’t be chosen twice; the spell requires two different legal targets. A spell that says “Destroy target artifact and target land,” however, can target the same artifact land twice because it uses the word “target” in multiple places.</p>
<p><a id="cr601.2d"><b>601.2d</b></a> If the spell requires the player to divide or distribute an effect (such as damage or counters) among one or more targets, the player announces the division. Each of these targets must receive at least one of whatever is being divided.</p>
<p><a id="cr601.2e"><b>601.2e</b></a> The game checks to see if proposed spell can legally be cast. If the proposed spell is illegal, the game returns to the moment before the casting of that spell was proposed (see rule <a href="#cr726">726</a>, “Handling Illegal Actions”).</p>
<p><a id="cr601.2f"><b>601.2f</b></a> The player determines the total cost of the spell. Usually this is just the mana cost. Some spells have additional or alternative costs. Some effects may increase or reduce the cost to pay, or may provide other alternative costs. Costs may include paying mana, tapping permanents, sacrificing permanents, discarding cards, and so on. The total cost is the mana cost or alternative cost (as determined in rule <a href="#cr601.2b">601.2b</a>), plus all additional costs and cost increases, and minus all cost reductions. If multiple cost reductions apply, the player may apply them in any order. If the mana component of the total cost is reduced to nothing by cost reduction effects, it is considered to be {0}. It can’t be reduced to less than {0}. Once the total cost is determined, any effects that directly affect the total cost are applied. Then the resulting total cost becomes “locked in.” If effects would change the total cost after this time, they have no effect.</p>
<p><a id="cr601.2g"><b>601.2g</b></a> If the total cost includes a mana payment, the player then has a chance to activate mana abilities (see rule <a href="#cr605">605</a>, “Mana Abilities”). Mana abilities must be activated before costs are paid.</p>
<p><a id="cr601.2h"><b>601.2h</b></a> The player pays the total cost. First, they pay all costs that don’t involve random elements or moving objects from the library to a public zone, in any order. Then they pay all remaining costs in any order. Partial payments are not allowed. Unpayable costs can’t be paid.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> You cast Altar’s Reap, which costs {1}{B} and has an additional cost of sacrificing a creature. You sacrifice Thunderscape Familiar, whose effect makes your black spells cost {1} less to cast. Because a spell’s total cost is “locked in” before payments are actually made, you pay {B}, not {1}{B}, even though you’re sacrificing the Familiar.</p>
<p><a id="cr601.2i"><b>601.2i</b></a> Once the steps described in 601.2a–h are completed, effects that modify the characteristics of the spell as it’s cast are applied, then the spell becomes cast. Any abilities that trigger when a spell is cast or put onto the stack trigger at this time. If the spell’s controller had priority before casting it, they get priority.</p>
<p><a id="cr601.3"><b>601.3.</b></a> A player can begin to cast a spell only if a rule or effect allows that player to cast it and no rule or effect prohibits that player from casting it.</p>
<p><a id="cr601.3a"><b>601.3a</b></a> If an effect prohibits a player from casting a spell with certain qualities, that player may consider any choices to be made during that spell’s proposal that may cause those qualities to change. If any such choices could cause that effect to no longer prohibit that player from casting that spell, the player may begin to cast the spell, ignoring the effect.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> A player controls Void Winnower, which reads, in part, “Your opponents can’t cast spells with even mana values.” That player’s opponent may begin to cast Rolling Thunder, a card whose mana cost is {X}{R}{R}, because the chosen value of X may cause the spell’s mana value to become odd.</p>
<p><a id="cr601.3b"><b>601.3b</b></a> If an effect allows a player to cast a spell with certain qualities as though it had flash, that player may consider any choices to be made during that spell’s proposal that may cause that spell’s qualities to change. If any such choices could cause that effect to apply, that player may begin to cast that spell as though it had flash.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> An effect says that you may cast Aura spells as though they had flash, and you have a creature card with bestow in your hand. Because choosing the bestow ability’s alternative cost causes that spell to become an Aura spell, you may legally begin to cast that spell as though it had flash.</p>
<p><a id="cr601.3c"><b>601.3c</b></a> If an effect allows a player to cast a spell as though it had flash only if an alternative or additional cost is paid, that player may begin to cast that spell as though it had flash.</p>
<p><a id="cr601.3d"><b>601.3d</b></a> If a spell would have flash only if certain conditions are met, its controller may begin to cast that spell as though it had flash if those conditions are met.</p>
<p><a id="cr601.3e"><b>601.3e</b></a> Some rules and effects state that an alternative set of characteristics or a subset of characteristics are considered to determine if a card or copy of a card is legal to cast. These alternative characteristics replace the object’s characteristics for this determination. Continuous effects that would apply to that object once it has those characteristics are also considered.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Garruk’s Horde says, in part, “You may cast creature spells from the top of your library.” If you control Garruk’s Horde and the top card of your library is a noncreature card with morph, you may cast it using its morph ability.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Melek, Izzet Paragon says, in part, “You may cast instant and sorcery spells from the top of your library.” If you control Melek, Izzet Paragon and the top card of your library is Giant Killer, an adventurer creature card whose Adventure is an instant named Chop Down, you may cast Chop Down but not Giant Killer. If instead you control Garruk’s Horde and the top card of your library is Giant Killer, you may cast Giant Killer but not Chop Down.</p>
<p><a id="cr601.3f"><b>601.3f</b></a> Some effects allow a player to cast a spell with certain qualities from among face-down cards in exile. A player may begin to cast such a spell only if they can look at the face-down card in exile.</p>
<p><a id="cr601.4"><b>601.4.</b></a> If a player is no longer allowed to cast a spell after completing its proposal (see rules <a href="#cr601.2a">601.2a</a>–d), the casting of the spell is illegal and the game returns to the moment before the casting of that spell was proposed (see rule <a href="#cr726">726</a>, “Handling Illegal Actions”). It doesn’t matter if a rule or effect would make the casting of the spell illegal while determining and paying that spell’s costs (see rules <a href="#cr601.2f">601.2f</a>–h) or any time after the spell has been cast.</p>
<p><a id="cr601.4a"><b>601.4a</b></a> Once a player has begun casting a spell that had flash because certain conditions were met or that could be cast as though it had flash because certain conditions were met (see 601.3d), they may continue to cast that spell as though it had flash even if those conditions stop being met.</p>
<p><a id="cr601.5"><b>601.5.</b></a> Some spells specify that one of their controller’s opponents does something the controller would normally do while it’s being cast, such as choose a mode or choose targets. In these cases, the opponent does so when the spell’s controller normally would do so.</p>
<p><a id="cr601.5a"><b>601.5a</b></a> If there is more than one opponent who could make such a choice, the spell’s controller decides which of those opponents will make the choice.</p>
<p><a id="cr601.5b"><b>601.5b</b></a> If the spell instructs its controller and another player to do something at the same time as the spell is being cast, the spell’s controller goes first, then the other player. This is an exception to rule <a href="#cr101.4">101.4</a>.</p>

<p><a id="cr602"><b>602. Activating Activated Abilities</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr602.1"><b>602.1.</b></a> Activated abilities have a cost and an effect. They are written as “[Cost]: [Effect.] [Activation instructions (if any).]”</p>
<p><a id="cr602.1a"><b>602.1a</b></a> The activation cost is everything before the colon (:). An ability’s activation cost must be paid by the player who is activating it.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> The activation cost of an ability that reads “{2}, {T}: You gain 1 life” is two mana of any type plus tapping the permanent that has the ability.</p>
<p><a id="cr602.1b"><b>602.1b</b></a> Some text after the colon of an activated ability states instructions that must be followed while activating that ability. Such text may state which players can activate that ability, may restrict when a player can activate the ability, or may define some aspect of the activation cost. This text is not part of the ability’s effect. It functions at all times. If an activated ability has any activation instructions, they appear last, after the ability’s effect.</p>
<p><a id="cr602.1c"><b>602.1c</b></a> An activated ability is the only kind of ability that can be activated. If an object or rule refers to activating an ability without specifying what kind, it must be referring to an activated ability.</p>
<p><a id="cr602.1d"><b>602.1d</b></a> Previously, the action of using an activated ability was referred to on cards as “playing” that ability. Cards that were printed with that text have received errata in the Oracle card reference so they now refer to “activating” that ability.</p>
<p><a id="cr602.2"><b>602.2.</b></a> To activate an ability is to put it onto the stack and pay its costs, so that it will eventually resolve and have its effect. Only an object’s controller (or its owner, if it doesn’t have a controller) can activate its activated ability unless the object specifically says otherwise. Activating an ability follows the steps listed below, in order. If, at any point during the activation of an ability, a player is unable to comply with any of those steps, the activation is illegal; the game returns to the moment before that ability started to be activated (see rule <a href="#cr726">726</a>, “Handling Illegal Actions”). Announcements and payments can’t be altered after they’ve been made.</p>
<p><a id="cr602.2a"><b>602.2a</b></a> The player announces that they are activating the ability. If an activated ability is being activated from a hidden zone, the card that has that ability is revealed. That ability is created on the stack as an object that’s not a card. It becomes the topmost object on the stack. It has the text of the ability that created it, and no other characteristics. Its controller is the player who activated the ability. The ability remains on the stack until it’s countered, it resolves, or an effect moves it elsewhere.</p>
<p><a id="cr602.2b"><b>602.2b</b></a> The remainder of the process for activating an ability is identical to the process for casting a spell listed in rules <a href="#cr601.2b">601.2b</a>–i. Those rules apply to activating an ability just as they apply to casting a spell. An activated ability’s analog to a spell’s mana cost (as referenced in rule <a href="#cr601.2f">601.2f</a>) is its activation cost.</p>
<p><a id="cr602.3"><b>602.3.</b></a> Some abilities specify that one of their controller’s opponents does something the controller would normally do while it’s being activated, such as choose a mode or choose targets.

<p><a id="cr602.5b"><b>602.5b</b></a> If an activated ability has a restriction on its use (for example, “Activate only once each turn”), the restriction continues to apply to that object even if its controller changes.</p>
<p><a id="cr602.5c"><b>602.5c</b></a> If an object acquires an activated ability with a restriction on its use from another object, that restriction applies only to that ability as acquired from that object. It doesn’t apply to other, identically worded abilities.</p>
<p><a id="cr602.5d"><b>602.5d</b></a> Activated abilities that read “Activate only as a sorcery” mean the player must follow the timing rules for casting a sorcery spell, though the ability isn’t actually a sorcery. The player doesn’t actually need to have a sorcery card that they could cast.</p>
<p><a id="cr602.5e"><b>602.5e</b></a> Activated abilities that read “Activate only as an instant” mean the player must follow the timing rules for casting an instant spell, though the ability isn’t actually an instant.

<p><a id="cr603"><b>603. Handling Triggered Abilities</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr603.1"><b>603.1.</b></a> Triggered abilities have a trigger condition and an effect. They are written as “[When/Whenever/At] [trigger condition or event], [effect]. [Instructions (if any).]”</p>
<p><a id="cr603.1a"><b>603.1a</b></a> A triggered ability may include instructions after its effects that limit what the ability may target or state that it can’t be countered. This text is not part of the ability’s effect. It functions while the ability is on the stack.</p>
<p><a id="cr603.2"><b>603.2.</b></a> Whenever a game event or game state matches a triggered ability’s trigger event, that ability automatically triggers. The ability doesn’t do anything at this point.</p>
<p><a id="cr603.2a"><b>603.2a</b></a> Because they aren’t cast or activated, triggered abilities can trigger even when it isn’t legal to cast spells and activate abilities. Effects that preclude abilities from being activated don’t affect them.</p>
<p><a id="cr603.2b"><b>603.2b</b></a> When a phase or step begins, all abilities that trigger “at the beginning of” that phase or step trigger.</p>
<p><a id="cr603.2c"><b>603.2c</b></a> An ability triggers only once each time its trigger event occurs. However, it can trigger repeatedly if one event contains multiple occurrences.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> A permanent has an ability whose trigger condition reads, “Whenever a land is put into a graveyard from the battlefield, . . . .” If someone casts a spell that destroys all lands, the ability will trigger once for each land put into the graveyard during the spell’s resolution.</p>
<p><a id="cr603.2d"><b>603.2d</b></a> An ability may state that a triggered ability triggers additional times. In this case, rather than simply determining that such an ability has triggered, determine how many times it should trigger, then that ability triggers that many times. An effect that states that an ability triggers additional times doesn’t invoke itself repeatedly and doesn’t apply to other effects that affect how many times an ability triggers.</p>
<p><a id="cr603.2e"><b>603.2e</b></a> Some effects refer to a triggered ability of an object. Such effects refer only to triggered abilities the object has, not any delayed triggered abilities (see rule <a href="#cr603.7">603.7</a>) that may be created by abilities the object has.</p>
<p><a id="cr603.2f"><b>603.2f</b></a> Some trigger events use the word “becomes” (for example, “becomes attached” or “becomes blocked”). These trigger only at the time the named event happens—they don’t trigger if that state already exists or retrigger if it persists. An ability that triggers when a permanent “becomes tapped” or “becomes untapped” doesn’t trigger if the permanent enters the battlefield in that state.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> An ability that triggers when a permanent “becomes tapped” triggers only when the status of a permanent that’s already on the battlefield changes from untapped to tapped.</p>
<p><a id="cr603.2g"><b>603.2g</b></a> If a triggered ability’s trigger condition is met, but the object with that triggered ability is at no time visible to all players, the ability does not trigger.</p>
<p><a id="cr603.2h"><b>603.2h</b></a> An ability triggers only if its trigger event actually occurs. An event that’s prevented or replaced won’t trigger anything.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> An ability that triggers on damage being dealt won’t trigger if all the damage is prevented.</p>
<p><a id="cr603.2i"><b>603.2i</b></a> A triggered ability may have an instruction followed by “Do this only once each turn.” This ability triggers only if its source’s controller has not yet taken the indicated action that turn.</p>
<p><a id="cr603.3"><b>603.3.</b></a> Once an ability has triggered, its controller puts it on the stack as an object that’s not a card the next time a player would receive priority. See rule <a href="#cr117">117</a>, “Timing and Priority.” The ability becomes the topmost object on the stack. It has the text of the ability that created it, and no other characteristics. It remains on the stack until it’s countered, it resolves, a rule causes it to be removed from the stack, or an effect moves it elsewhere.</p>
<p><a id="cr603.3a"><b>603.3a</b></a> A triggered ability is controlled by the player who controlled its source at the time it triggered, unless it’s a delayed triggered ability. To determine the controller of a delayed triggered ability, see rules <a href="#cr603.7d">603.7d</a>–f.</p>
<p><a id="cr603.3b"><b>603.3b</b></a> If multiple abilities have triggered since the last time a player received priority, the abilities are placed on the stack in a two-part process. First, each player, in APNAP order, puts each triggered ability they control with a trigger condition that isn’t another ability triggering on the stack in any order they choose. (See rule <a href="#cr101.4">101.4</a>.) Second, each player, in APNAP order, puts all remaining triggered abilities they control on the stack in any order they choose. Then the game once again checks for and performs state-based actions until none are performed, then abilities that triggered during this process go on the stack. This process repeats until no new state-based actions are performed and no abilities trigger. Then the appropriate player gets priority.</p>
<p><a id="cr603.3c"><b>603.3c</b></a> If a triggered ability is modal, its controller announces the mode choice when putting the ability on the stack. If one of the modes would be illegal (due to an inability to choose legal targets, for example), that mode can’t be chosen. If no mode is chosen, the ability is removed from the stack. (See rule <a href="#cr700.2">700.2</a>.)</p>
<p><a id="cr603.3d"><b>603.3d</b></a> The remainder of the process for putting a triggered ability on the stack is identical to the process for casting a spell listed in rules <a href="#cr601.2c">601.2c</a>–d. If a choice is required when the triggered ability goes on the stack but no legal choices can be made for it, or if a rule or a continuous effect otherwise makes the ability illegal, the ability is simply removed from the stack.</p>
<p><a id="cr603.4"><b>603.4.</b></a> A triggered ability may read “When/Whenever/At [trigger event], if [condition], [effect].” When the trigger event occurs, the ability checks whether the stated condition is true. The ability triggers only if it is; otherwise it does nothing. If the ability triggers, it checks the stated condition again as it resolves. If the condition isn’t true at that time, the ability is removed from the stack and does nothing. Note that this mirrors the check for legal targets. This rule is referred to as the “intervening ‘if’ clause” rule. (The word “if” has only its normal English meaning anywhere else in the text of a card; this rule only applies to an “if” that immediately follows a trigger condition.)<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Felidar Sovereign reads, “At the beginning of your upkeep, if you have 40 or more life, you win the game.” Its controller’s life total is checked as that player’s upkeep begins. If that player has 39 or less life, the ability doesn’t trigger at all. If that player has 40 or more life, the ability triggers and goes on the stack. As the ability resolves, that player’s life total is checked again. If that player has 39 or less life at this time, the ability is removed from the stack and has no effect. If that player has 40 or more life at this time, the ability resolves and that player wins the game.</p>
<p><a id="cr603.5"><b>603.5.</b></a> Some triggered abilities’ effects are optional (they contain “may,” as in “At the beginning of your upkeep, you may draw a card”). These abilities go on the stack when they trigger, regardless of whether their controller intends to exercise the ability’s option or not. The choice is made when the ability resolves. Likewise, triggered abilities that have an effect “unless” something is true or a player chooses to do something will go on the stack normally; the “unless” part of the ability is dealt with when the ability resolves.</p>
<p><a id="cr603.6"><b>603.6.</b></a> Trigger events that involve objects changing zones are called “zone-change triggers.” Many abilities with zone-change triggers attempt to do something to that object after it changes zones. During resolution, these abilities look for the object in the zone that it moved to. If the object is unable to be found in the zone it went to, the part of the ability attempting to do something to the object will fail to do anything. The ability could be unable to find the object because the object never entered the specified zone, because it left the zone before the ability resolved, or because it is in a zone that is hidden from a player, such as a library or an opponent’s hand. (This rule applies even if the object leaves the zone and returns again before the ability resolves.) The most common zone-change triggers are enters-the-battlefield triggers and leaves-the-battlefield triggers.</p>
<p><a id="cr603.6a"><b>603.6a</b></a> Enters-the-battlefield abilities trigger when a permanent enters the battlefield. These are written, “When [this object] enters the battlefield, . . . “ or “Whenever a [type] enters the battlefield, . . .” Each time an event puts one or more permanents onto the battlefield, all permanents on the battlefield (including the newcomers) are checked for any enters-the-battlefield triggers that match the event.</p>
<p><a id="cr603.6b"><b>603.6b</b></a> Continuous effects that modify characteristics of a permanent do so the moment the permanent is on the battlefield (and not before then). The permanent is never on the battlefield with its unmodified characteristics. Continuous effects don’t apply before the permanent is on the battlefield, however (see rule <a href="#cr603.6d">603.6d</a>).<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> If an effect reads “All lands are creatures” and a land card is played, the effect makes the land card into a creature the moment it enters the battlefield, so it would trigger abilities that trigger when a creature enters the battlefield. Conversely, if an effect reads “All creatures lose all abilities” and a creature card with an enters-the-battlefield triggered ability enters the battlefield, that effect will cause it to lose its abilities the moment it enters the battlefield, so the enters-the-battlefield ability won’t trigger.</p>
<p><a id="cr603.6c"><b>603.6c</b></a> Leaves-the-battlefield abilities trigger when a permanent moves from the battlefield to another zone, or when a phased-in permanent leaves the game because its owner leaves the game. These are written as, but aren’t limited to, “When [this object] leaves the battlefield, . . .” or “Whenever [something] is put into a graveyard from the battlefield, . . . .” (See also rule <a href="#cr603.10">603.10</a>.) An ability that attempts to do something to the card that left the battlefield checks for it only in the first zone that it went to. An ability that triggers when a card is put into a certain zone “from anywhere” is never treated as a leaves-the-battlefield ability, even if an object is put into that zone from the battlefield.</p>
<p><a id="cr603.6d"><b>603.6d</b></a> Some permanents have text that reads “[This permanent] enters the battlefield with . . . ,” “As [this permanent] enters the battlefield . . . ,” “[This permanent] enters the battlefield as . . . ,” or “[This permanent] enters the battlefield tapped.” Such text is a static ability—not a triggered ability—whose effect occurs as part of the event that puts the permanent onto the battlefield.</p>
<p><a id="cr603.6e"><b>603.6e</b></a> Some Auras have triggered abilities that trigger on the enchanted permanent leaving the battlefield. These triggered abilities can find the new object that permanent card became in the zone it moved to; they can also find the new object the Aura card became in its owner’s graveyard after state-based actions have been checked. See rule <a href="#cr400.7">400.7</a>.</p>
<p><a id="cr603.7"><b>603.7.</b></a> An effect may create a delayed triggered ability that can do something at a later time. A delayed triggered ability will contain “when,” “whenever,” or “at,” although that word won’t usually begin the ability.</p>
<p><a id="cr603.7a"><b>603.7a</b></a> Delayed triggered abilities are created during the resolution of spells or abilities, as the result of a replacement effect being applied, or as a result of a static ability that allows a player to take an action. A delayed triggered ability won’t trigger until it has actually been created, even if its trigger event occurred just beforehand. Other events that happen earlier may make the trigger event impossible.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Part of an effect reads “When this creature leaves the battlefield,” but the creature in question leaves the battlefield before the spell or ability creating the effect resolves. In this case, the delayed ability never triggers.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> If an effect reads “When this creature becomes untapped” and the named creature becomes untapped before the effect resolves, the ability waits for the next time that creature untaps.</p>
<p><a id="cr603.7b"><b>603.7b</b></a> A delayed triggered ability will trigger only once—the next time its trigger event occurs—unless it has a stated duration, such as “this turn.” If its trigger event occurs more than once simultaneously and the ability doesn’t have a stated duration, the controller of the delayed triggered ability chooses which event causes the ability to trigger.</p>
<p><a id="cr603.7c"><b>603.7c</b></a> A delayed triggered ability that refers to a particular object still affects it even if the object changes characteristics. However, if that object is no longer in the zone it’s expected to be in at the time the delayed triggered ability resolves, the ability won’t affect it. (Note that if that object left that zone and then returned, it’s a new object and thus won’t be affected. See rule <a href="#cr400.7">400.7</a>.)<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> An ability that reads “Exile this creature at the beginning of the next end step” will exile the permanent even if it’s no longer a creature during the next end step. However, it won’t do anything if the permanent left the battlefield before then.</p>
<p><a id="cr603.7d"><b>603.7d</b></a> If a spell creates a delayed triggered ability, the source of that delayed triggered ability is that spell. The controller of that delayed triggered ability is the player who controlled that spell as it resolved.</p>
<p><a id="cr603.7e"><b>603.7e</b></a> If an activated or triggered ability creates a delayed triggered ability, the source of that delayed triggered ability is the same as the source of that other ability. The controller of that delayed triggered ability is the player who controlled that other ability as it resolved.</p>
<p><a id="cr603.7f"><b>603.7f</b></a> If a static ability generates a replacement effect which causes a delayed triggered ability to be created, the source of that delayed triggered ability is the object with that static ability. The controller of that delayed triggered ability is the same as the controller of that object at the time the replacement effect was applied.</p>
<p><a id="cr603.7g"><b>603.7g</b></a> If a static ability allows a player to take an action and creates a delayed triggered ability if that player does so, the source of that delayed triggered ability is the object with that static ability. The controller of that delayed triggered ability is the same as the controller of that object at the time the action was taken.</p>
<p><a id="cr603.8"><b>603.8.</b></a> Some triggered abilities trigger when a game state (such as a player controlling no permanents of a particular card type) is true, rather than triggering when an event occurs. These abilities trigger as soon as the game state matches the condition. They’ll go onto the stack at the next available opportunity. These are called state triggers. (Note that state triggers aren’t the same as state-based actions.) A state-triggered ability doesn’t trigger again until the ability has resolved, has been countered, or has otherwise left the stack. Then, if the object with the ability is still in the same zone and the game state still matches its trigger condition, the ability will trigger again.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> A permanent’s ability reads, “Whenever you have no cards in hand, draw a card.” If its controller plays the last card from their hand, the ability will trigger once and won’t trigger again until it has left the stack. If its controller casts a spell that reads “Discard your hand, then draw that many cards,” the ability will trigger during the spell’s resolution because the player’s hand was momentarily empty.</p>
<p><a id="cr603.9"><b>603.9.</b></a> Some triggered abilities trigger specifically when a player loses the game. These abilities trigger when a player loses or leaves the game, regardless of the reason, unless that player leaves the game as the result of a draw. See rule <a href="#cr104.3">104.3</a>.</p>
<p><a id="cr603.10"><b>603.10.</b></a> Normally, objects that exist immediately after an event are checked to see if the event matched any trigger conditions, and continuous effects that exist at that time are used to determine what the trigger conditions are and what the objects involved in the event look like. However, some triggered abilities are exceptions to this rule; the game “looks back in time” to determine if those abilities trigger, using the existence of those abilities and the appearance of objects immediately prior to the event. The list of exceptions is as follows:</p>
<p><a id="cr603.10a"><b>603.10a</b></a> Some zone-change triggers look back in time. These are leaves-the-battlefield abilities, abilities that trigger when a card leaves a graveyard, and abilities that trigger when an object that all players can see is put into a hand or library.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Two creatures are on the battlefield along with an artifact that has the ability “Whenever a creature dies, you gain 1 life.” Someone casts a spell that destroys all artifacts, creatures, and enchantments. The artifact’s ability triggers twice, even though the artifact goes to its owner’s graveyard at the same time as the creatures.</p>
<p><a id="cr603.10b"><b>603.10b</b></a> Abilities that trigger when a permanent phases out look back in time.</p>
<p><a id="cr603.10c"><b>603.10c</b></a> Abilities that trigger specifically when an object becomes unattached look back in time.</p>
<p><a id="cr603.10d"><b>603.10d</b></a> Abilities that trigger when a player loses control of an object look back in time.</p>
<p><a id="cr603.10e"><b>603.10e</b></a> Abilities that trigger when a spell is countered look back in time.</p>
<p><a id="cr603.10f"><b>603.10f</b></a> Abilities that trigger when a player loses the game look back in time.</p>
<p><a id="cr603.10g"><b>603.10g</b></a> Abilities that trigger when a player planeswalks away from a plane look back in time.</p>
<p><a id="cr603.11"><b>603.11.</b></a> Some objects have a static ability that’s linked to one or more triggered abilities. (See rule <a href="#cr607">607</a>, “Linked Abilities.”) These objects combine the abilities into one paragraph, with the static ability first, followed by each triggered ability that’s linked to it. A very few objects have triggered abilities which are written with the trigger condition in the middle of the ability, rather than at the beginning.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> An ability that reads “Reveal the first card you draw each turn. Whenever you reveal a basic land card this way, draw a card” is a static ability linked to a triggered ability.</p>
<p><a id="cr603.12"><b>603.12.</b></a> A resolving spell or ability may allow or instruct a player to take an action and create a triggered ability that triggers “when [a player] [does or doesn’t]” take that action or “when [something happens] this way.” These reflexive triggered abilities follow the rules for delayed triggered abilities (see rule <a href="#cr603.7">603.7</a>), except that they’re checked immediately after being created and trigger based on whether the trigger event or events occurred earlier during the resolution of the spell or ability that created them.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Heart-Piercer Manticore has an ability that reads “When Heart-Piercer Manticore enters the battlefield, you may sacrifice another creature. When you do, Heart-Piercer Manticore deals damage equal to that creature’s power to any target.” The reflexive triggered ability triggers only when you sacrifice another creature due to the original triggered ability, and not if you sacrifice a creature for any other reason.</p>
<p><a id="cr603.12a"><b>603.12a</b></a> Normally, if the trigger event or events occur multiple times during the resolution of the spell or ability that created it, the reflexive triggered ability will trigger once for each of those times. However, if a resolving spell or ability includes a choice to pay a cost “any number of times” and creates a triggered ability that triggers “when [a player] pays [that cost] one or more times,” paying that cost one or more times causes the reflexive triggered ability to trigger only once.</p>
<p><b>★</b> <a id="cr603.13"><b>603.13.</b></a> Some objects have a triggered ability that has an optional effect that can be done a limited number of times each turn. Once the option has been chosen that limited number of times for that object in a turn, it can't be chosen again that turn and the ability will stop triggering for the turn.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> An ability reads “Once each turn, when you discard a card, you may draw a card.” If you discard two cards simultaneously, the ability will trigger twice. If you choose to draw a card when the first ability resolves, you will be unable to draw a card when the second resolves. If you then discard another card this turn, the ability won't trigger at all.</p>
<p><a id="cr604"><b>604. Handling Static Abilities</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr604.1"><b>604.1.</b></a> Static abilities do something all the time rather than being activated or triggered. They are written as statements, and they’re simply true.</p>
<p><a id="cr604.2"><b>604.2.</b></a> Static abilities create continuous effects, some of which are prevention effects or replacement effects. These effects are active as long as the permanent with the ability remains on the battlefield and has the ability, or as long as the object with the ability remains in the appropriate zone, as described in rule <a href="#cr113.6">113.6</a>.</p>
<p><a id="cr604.3"><b>604.3.</b></a> Some static abilities are characteristic-defining abilities. A characteristic-defining ability conveys information about an object’s characteristics that would normally be found elsewhere on that object (such as in its mana cost, type line, or power/toughness box). Characteristic-defining abilities can add to or override information found elsewhere on that object. Characteristic-defining abilities function in all zones. They also function outside the game and before the game begins.</p>
<p><a id="cr604.3a"><b>604.3a</b></a> A static ability is a characteristic-defining ability if it meets the following criteria: (1) It defines an object’s colors, subtypes, power, or toughness; (2) it is printed on the card it affects, it was granted to the token it affects by the effect that created the token, or it was acquired by the object it affects as the result of a copy effect or text-changing effect; (3) it does not directly affect the characteristics of any other objects; (4) it is not an ability that an object grants to itself; and (5) it does not set the values of such characteristics only if certain conditions are met.</p>
<p><a id="cr604.4"><b>604.4.</b></a> Many Auras, Equipment, and Fortifications have static abilities that modify the object they’re attached to, but those abilities don’t target that object. If an Aura, Equipment, or Fortification is moved to a different object, the ability stops applying to the original object and starts modifying the new one.</p>
<p><a id="cr604.5"><b>604.5.</b></a> Some static abilities apply while a spell is on the stack. These are often abilities that refer to countering the spell. Also, abilities that say “As an additional cost to cast . . . ,” “You may pay [cost] rather than pay [this object]’s mana cost,” and “You may cast [this object] without paying its mana cost” work while a spell is on the stack.</p>
<p><a id="cr604.6"><b>604.6.</b></a> Some static abilities apply while a card is in any zone that you could cast or play it from (usually your hand). These are limited to those that read, “You may [cast/play] [this card] . . . ,” “You can’t [cast/play] [this card] . . . ,” and “[Cast/Play] [this card] only . . . .”</p>
<p><a id="cr604.7"><b>604.7.</b></a> Unlike spells and other kinds of abilities, static abilities can’t use an object’s last known information for purposes of determining how their effects are applied.</p>
<p><a id="cr605"><b>605. Mana Abilities</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr605.1"><b>605.1.</b></a> Some activated abilities and some triggered abilities are mana abilities, which are subject to special rules. Only abilities that meet either of the following two sets of criteria are mana abilities, regardless of what other effects they may generate or what timing restrictions (such as “Activate only as an instant”) they may have.</p>
<p><a id="cr605.1a"><b>605.1a</b></a> An activated ability is a mana ability if it meets all of the following criteria: it doesn’t require a target (see rule <a href="#cr115.6">115.6</a>), it could add mana to a player’s mana pool when it resolves, and it’s not a loyalty ability. (See rule <a href="#cr606">606</a>, “Loyalty Abilities.”)</p>
<p><a id="cr605.1b"><b>605.1b</b></a> A triggered ability is a mana ability if it meets all of the following criteria: it doesn’t require a target (see rule <a href="#cr115.6">115.6</a>), it triggers from the activation or resolution of an activated mana ability (see rule <a href="#cr605.1a">605.1a</a>) or from mana being added to a player’s mana pool, and it could add mana to a player’s mana pool when it resolves.</p>
<p><a id="cr605.2"><b>605.2.</b></a> A mana ability remains a mana ability even if the game state doesn’t allow it to produce mana.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> A permanent has an ability that reads “{T}: Add {G} for each creature you control.” The ability is still a mana ability even if you control no creatures or if the permanent is already tapped.</p>
<p><a id="cr605.3"><b>605.3.</b></a> Activating an activated mana ability follows the rules for activating any other activated ability (see rule <a href="#cr602.2">602.2</a>), with the following exceptions:</p>
<p><a id="cr605.3a"><b>605.3a</b></a> A player may activate an activated mana ability whenever they have priority, whenever they are casting a spell or activating an ability that requires a mana payment, or whenever a rule or effect asks for a mana payment, even if it’s in the middle of casting or resolving a spell or activating or resolving an ability.</p>
<p><a id="cr605.3b"><b>605.3b</b></a> An activated mana ability doesn’t go on the stack, so it can’t be targeted, countered, or otherwise responded to. Rather, it resolves immediately after it is activated. (See rule <a href="#cr405.6c">405.6c</a>.)</p>
<p><a id="cr605.3c"><b>605.3c</b></a> Once a player begins to activate a mana ability, that ability can’t be activated again until it has resolved.</p>
<p><a id="cr605.4"><b>605.4.</b></a> Triggered mana abilities follow all the rules for other triggered abilities (see rule <a href="#cr603">603</a>, “Handling Triggered Abilities”), with the following exception:</p>
<p><a id="cr605.4a"><b>605.4a</b></a> A triggered mana ability doesn’t go on the stack, so it can’t be targeted, countered, or otherwise responded to. Rather, it resolves immediately after the mana ability that triggered it, without waiting for priority.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> An enchantment reads, “Whenever a player taps a land for mana, that player adds one mana of any type that land produced.” If a player taps lands for mana while casting a spell, the additional mana is added immediately and can be used to pay for the spell.</p>
<p><a id="cr605.5"><b>605.5.</b></a> Abilities that don’t meet the criteria specified in rules <a href="#cr605.1a">605.1a</a>–b and spells aren’t mana abilities.</p>
<p><a id="cr605.5a"><b>605.5a</b></a> An ability with a target is not a mana ability, even if it could put mana into a player’s mana pool when it resolves. The same is true for a triggered ability that could produce mana but triggers from an event other than activating a mana ability, or a triggered ability that triggers from activating a mana ability but couldn’t produce mana. These follow the normal rules for activated or triggered abilities, as appropriate.</p>
<p><a id="cr605.5b"><b>605.5b</b></a> A spell can never be a mana ability, even if it could put mana into a player’s mana pool when it resolves. It’s cast and resolves just like any other spell. Some older cards were printed with the card type “mana source”; these cards have received errata in the Oracle card reference and are now instants.</p>
<p><a id="cr606"><b>606. Loyalty Abilities</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr606.1"><b>606.1.</b></a> Some activated abilities are loyalty abilities, which are subject to special rules.</p>
<p><a id="cr606.2"><b>606.2.</b></a> An activated ability with a loyalty symbol in its cost is a loyalty ability. Normally, only planeswalkers have loyalty abilities.</p>
<p><a id="cr606.3"><b>606.3.</b></a> A player may activate a loyalty ability of a permanent they control any time they have priority and the stack is empty during a main phase of their turn, but only if no player has previously activated a loyalty ability of that permanent that turn.</p>
<p><a id="cr606.4"><b>606.4.</b></a> The cost to activate a loyalty ability of a permanent is to put on or remove from that permanent a certain number of loyalty counters, as shown by the loyalty symbol in the ability’s cost. This cost may be modified by other effects.</p>
<p><a id="cr606.5"><b>606.5.</b></a> If the total cost to activate a loyalty ability contains multiple costs to add or remove loyalty counters, those costs are combined into a single cost to add or remove loyalty counters, as appropriate.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> A player controls Carth the Lion, which says, in part, “Planeswalkers’ loyalty abilities you control cost an additional [+1] to activate. That player also controls a planeswalker with three loyalty counters. To activate one of that planeswalker’s abilities that normally costs [+1], they put two loyalty counters on it. To activate one of its abilities that normally costs [−4], they remove three loyalty counters from it.</p>
<p><a id="cr606.6"><b>606.6.</b></a> A loyalty ability with a negative loyalty cost, taking into account any additional costs, can’t be activated unless the permanent has at least that many loyalty counters on it.</p>
<p><a id="cr607"><b>607. Linked Abilities</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr607.1"><b>607.1.</b></a> An object may have two abilities printed on it such that one of them causes actions to be taken or objects or players to be affected and the other one directly refers to those actions, objects, or players. If so, these two abilities are linked: the second refers only to actions that were taken or objects or players that were affected by the first, and not by any other ability.</p>
<p><a id="cr607.1a"><b>607.1a</b></a> An ability printed on an object within another ability that grants that ability to that object is considered to be “printed on” that object for these purposes.</p>
<p><a id="cr607.1b"><b>607.1b</b></a> An ability printed on either face of a transforming double-faced card (see rule <a href="#cr712">712</a>) is considered to be “printed on” that object for these purposes, regardless of which face is up.</p>
<p><a id="cr607.1c"><b>607.1c</b></a> An ability printed on an object that fulfills both criteria described in rule <a href="#cr607.1">607.1</a> is linked to itself.</p>
<p><a id="cr607.1d"><b>607.1d</b></a> Abilities printed on two objects can be linked if one object is a token or emblem and the second object was the source of the ability that created the token or emblem. In these cases, the abilities fit the criteria listed for one of the different kinds of linked abilities in rule <a href="#cr607.2">607.2</a> except they are printed on two objects rather than one.</p>
<p><a id="cr607.2"><b>607.2.</b></a> There are different kinds of linked abilities.</p>
<p><a id="cr607.2a"><b>607.2a</b></a> If an object has an activated or triggered ability printed on it that instructs a player to exile one or more cards and an ability printed on it that refers either to “the exiled cards” or to cards “exiled with [this object],” these abilities are linked. The second ability refers only to cards in the exile zone that were put there as a result of an instruction to exile them in the first ability.</p>
<p><a id="cr607.2b"><b>607.2b</b></a> If an object has an ability printed on it that generates a replacement effect which causes one or more cards to be exiled and an ability printed on it that refers either to “the exiled cards” or to cards “exiled with [this object],” these abilities are linked. The second ability refers only to cards in the exile zone that were put there as a direct result of a replacement event caused by the first ability. See rule <a href="#cr614">614</a>, “Replacement Effects.”</p>
<p><a id="cr607.2c"><b>607.2c</b></a> If an object has an activated or triggered ability printed on it that puts one or more objects onto the battlefield and an ability printed on it that refers to objects “put onto the battlefield with [this object]” or “created with [this object],” those abilities are linked. The second can refer only to objects put onto the battlefield as a result of the first.</p>
<p><a id="cr607.2d"><b>607.2d</b></a> If an object has an ability printed on it that causes a player to “choose a [value]” and an ability printed on it that refers to “the chosen [value],” “the last chosen [value],” or similar, those abilities are linked. The second ability refers only to a choice made as a result of the first ability.</p>
<p><a id="cr607.2e"><b>607.2e</b></a> If an object has an ability printed on it that allows some information to be noted and another ability which refers to information noted for that object, those abilities are linked.

The second ability refers only to a cost paid as a result of the first ability.</p>
<p><a id="cr607.2h"><b>607.2h</b></a> If an object has both a static ability and one or more triggered abilities printed on it in the same paragraph, each of those triggered abilities is linked to the static ability. Each triggered ability refers only to actions taken as a result of the static ability. See rule <a href="#cr603.11">603.11</a>.</p>
<p><a id="cr607.2i"><b>607.2i</b></a> If an object has a kicker ability printed on it and an ability printed on it that refers to whether that object was kicked, those abilities are linked. The second refers only to whether the intent to pay the kicker cost listed in the first was declared as the object was cast as a spell. If a kicker ability lists multiple costs, it will have multiple abilities linked to it. Each of those abilities will specify which kicker cost it refers to. See rule <a href="#cr702.33">702.33</a>, “Kicker.”</p>
<p><a id="cr607.2j"><b>607.2j</b></a> If an object has an ability printed on it that causes a player to pay a variable additional cost as it’s cast and an ability printed on it that refers to the cost paid “as [this object] was cast,” these abilities are linked. The second refers only to the value chosen for the cost listed in the first as the object was cast as a spell. See rule <a href="#cr601.2b">601.2b</a>.</p>
<p><a id="cr607.2k"><b>607.2k</b></a> The two abilities represented by the champion keyword are linked abilities. See rule <a href="#cr702.72">702.72</a>, “Champion.”</p>

<p><a id="cr607.2p"><b>607.2p</b></a> If an object has both a static ability that causes a player to make a choice for a characteristic-defining ability before the game begins and that characteristic-defining ability printed on it in the same paragraph, those abilities are linked.

<p><a id="cr607.2q"><b>607.2q</b></a> If a permanent spell has an ability printed on it that allows one or more cards to be exiled while paying a cost to cast it and the permanent that spell becomes has an ability that refers to cards “exiled with [this object],” those abilities are linked. The second ability refers only to cards exiled to pay the cost of the spell that became that permanent.</p>
<p><a id="cr607.3"><b>607.3.</b></a> If, within a pair of linked abilities, one ability refers to a single object as “the exiled card,” “a card exiled with [this card],” or a similar phrase, and the other ability has exiled multiple cards (usually because it was copied), the ability refers to each of the exiled cards. If that ability asks for any information about the exiled card, such as a characteristic or mana value, it gets multiple answers. If these answers are used to determine the value of a variable, the sum of the answers is used. If that ability performs any actions on “the” card, it performs that action on each exiled card. If that ability performs any actions on “a” card, the controller of the ability chooses which card is affected.</p>
<p><a id="cr607.4"><b>607.4.</b></a> An ability may be part of more than one pair of linked abilities.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Paradise Plume has the following three abilities: “As Paradise Plume enters the battlefield, choose a color,” “Whenever a player casts a spell of the chosen color, you may gain 1 life,” and “{T}: Add one mana of the chosen color.” The first and second abilities are linked. The first and third abilities are linked.</p>
<p><a id="cr607.5"><b>607.5.</b></a> If an object acquires a pair of linked abilities as part of the same effect, the abilities will be similarly linked to one another on that object even though they weren’t printed on that object. They can’t be linked to any other ability, regardless of what other abilities the object may currently have or may have had in the past.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Arc-Slogger has the ability “{R}, Exile the top ten cards of your library: Arc-Slogger deals 2 damage to any target.” Sisters of Stone Death has the ability “{B}{G}: Exile target creature blocking or blocked by Sisters of Stone Death” and the ability “{2}{B}: Put a creature card exiled with Sisters of Stone Death onto the battlefield under your control.” Quicksilver Elemental has the ability “{U}: Quicksilver Elemental gains all activated abilities of target creature until end of turn.” If a player has Quicksilver Elemental gain Arc-Slogger’s ability, activates it, then has Quicksilver Elemental gain Sisters of Stone Death’s abilities, activates the exile ability, and then activates the return-to-the-battlefield ability, only the creature card Quicksilver Elemental exiled with Sisters of Stone Death’s ability can be returned to the battlefield.

<p><a id="cr607.5a"><b>607.5a</b></a> If an object gains an ability that refers to a choice, but either (a) doesn’t copy that ability’s linked ability or (b) does copy the linked ability but no choice is made for it, then the choice is considered to be “undefined.” If an ability refers to an undefined choice, that part of the ability won’t do anything.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Voice of All enters the battlefield and Unstable Shapeshifter copies it. Voice of All reads, in part, “As Voice of All enters the battlefield, choose a color.” and “Voice of All has protection from the chosen color.” Unstable Shapeshifter never had a chance for a color to be chosen for it, because it didn’t enter the battlefield as Voice of All so it doesn’t gain a protection ability.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> A Vesuvan Doppelganger enters the battlefield as a copy of Voice of All, and the Doppelganger’s controller chooses blue. Later, the Doppelganger copies Quirion Elves, which has the ability, “{T}: Add one mana of the chosen color.” Even though a color was chosen for the Doppelganger, it wasn’t chosen for the ability linked to the mana ability copied from the Elves. If that mana ability of the Doppelganger is activated, it will not produce mana.</p>
<p><a id="cr608"><b>608. Resolving Spells and Abilities</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr608.1"><b>608.1.</b></a> Each time all players pass in succession, the spell or ability on top of the stack resolves. (See rule <a href="#cr609">609</a>, “Effects.”)</p>
<p><a id="cr608.2"><b>608.2.</b></a> If the object that’s resolving is an instant spell, a sorcery spell, or an ability, its resolution may involve several steps. The steps described in rules <a href="#cr608.2a">608.2a</a> and <a href="#cr608.2b">608.2b</a> are followed first. The steps described in rules <a href="#cr608.2c">608.2c</a>–k are then followed as appropriate, in no specific order. The step described in rule <a href="#cr608.2m">608.2m</a> is followed last.</p>
<p><a id="cr608.2a"><b>608.2a</b></a> If a triggered ability has an intervening “if” clause, it checks whether the clause’s condition is true. If it isn’t, the ability is removed from the stack and does nothing. Otherwise, it continues to resolve. See rule <a href="#cr603.4">603.4</a>.</p>
<p><a id="cr608.2b"><b>608.2b</b></a> If the spell or ability specifies targets, it checks whether the targets are still legal. A target that’s no longer in the zone it was in when it was targeted is illegal. Other changes to the game state may cause a target to no longer be legal; for example, its characteristics may have changed or an effect may have changed the text of the spell. If the source of an ability has left the zone it was in, its last known information is used during this process. If all its targets, for every instance of the word “target,” are now illegal, the spell or ability doesn’t resolve. It’s removed from the stack and, if it’s a spell, put into its owner’s graveyard. Otherwise, the spell or ability will resolve normally. Illegal targets, if any, won’t be affected by parts of a resolving spell’s effect for which they’re illegal. Other parts of the effect for which those targets are not illegal may still affect them. If the spell or ability creates any continuous effects that affect game rules (see rule <a href="#cr613.11">613.11</a>), those effects don’t apply to illegal targets. If part of the effect requires information about an illegal target, it fails to determine any such information. Any part of the effect that requires that information won’t happen.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Sorin’s Thirst is a black instant that reads, “Sorin’s Thirst deals 2 damage to target creature and you gain 2 life.” If the creature isn’t a legal target during the resolution of Sorin’s Thirst (say, if the creature has gained protection from black or left the battlefield), then Sorin’s Thirst doesn’t resolve. Its controller doesn’t gain any life.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Plague Spores reads, “Destroy target nonblack creature and target land. They can’t be regenerated.” Suppose the same creature land is chosen both as the nonblack creature and as the land, and the color of the creature land is changed to black before Plague Spores resolves. Plague Spores still resolves because the black creature land is still a legal target for the “target land” part of the spell. The “destroy target nonblack creature” part of the spell won’t affect that permanent, but the “destroy target land” part of the spell will still destroy it. It can’t be regenerated.</p>
<p><a id="cr608.2c"><b>608.2c</b></a> The controller of the spell or ability follows its instructions in the order written. However, replacement effects may modify these actions. In some cases, later text on the card may modify the meaning of earlier text (for example, “Destroy target creature. It can’t be regenerated” or “Counter target spell. If that spell is countered this way, put it on top of its owner’s library instead of into its owner’s graveyard.”) Don’t just apply effects step by step without thinking in these cases—read the whole text and apply the rules of English to the text.</p>
<p><a id="cr608.2d"><b>608.2d</b></a> If an effect of a spell or ability offers any choices other than choices already made as part of casting the spell, activating the ability, or otherwise putting the spell or ability on the stack, the player announces these while applying the effect. The player can’t choose an option that’s illegal or impossible, with the exception that having a library with no cards in it doesn’t make drawing a card an impossible action (see rule <a href="#cr121.3">121.3</a>). If an effect divides or distributes something, such as damage or counters, as a player chooses among any number of untargeted players and/or objects, the player chooses the amount and division such that each chosen player or object receives at least one of whatever is being divided. (Note that if an effect divides or distributes something, such as damage or counters, as a player chooses among some number of target objects and/or players, the amount and division were determined as the spell or ability was put onto the stack rather than at this time; see rule <a href="#cr601.2d">601.2d</a>.)<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> A spell’s instruction reads, “You may sacrifice a creature. If you don’t, you lose 4 life.” A player who controls no creatures can’t choose the sacrifice option.</p>
<p><a id="cr608.2e"><b>608.2e</b></a> Some spells and abilities have multiple steps or actions, denoted by separate sentences or clauses, that involve multiple players. In these cases, the choices for the first action are made in APNAP order, and then the first action is processed simultaneously. Then the choices for the second action are made in APNAP order, and then that action is processed simultaneously, and so on. See rule <a href="#cr101.4">101.4</a>.</p>
<p><a id="cr608.2f"><b>608.2f</b></a> Some spells and abilities include actions taken on multiple players and/or objects. In most cases, each such action is processed simultaneously. If the action can’t be processed simultaneously, it’s instead processed considering each affected player or object individually. APNAP order is used to make the primary determination of the order of those actions. Secondarily, if the action is to be taken on both a player and an object they control or on multiple objects controlled by the same player, the player who controls the resolving spell or ability chooses the relative order of those actions. <br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Blatant Thievery says “For each opponent, gain control of target permanent that player controls.” As Blatant Thievery resolves, its controller gains control of all permanents chosen as targets simultaneously.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Soulfire Eruption says, in part, “Choose any number of target creatures, planeswalkers, and/or players. For each of them, exile the top card of your library, then Soulfire Eruption deals damage equal to that card’s mana value to that permanent or player.” A player casts Soulfire Eruption targeting an opponent and a creature that opponent controls. As Soulfire Eruption resolves, the player can’t exile the top card of their library multiple times at the same time, so they first choose which target they are considering, then they exile the top card of their library, and finally Soulfire Eruption deals damage to that target. They then repeat this process for the remaining target. </p>
<p><a id="cr608.2g"><b>608.2g</b></a> If an effect gives a player the option to pay mana, they may activate mana abilities before taking that action. If an effect specifically instructs or allows a player to cast a spell during resolution, they do so by following the steps in rules <a href="#cr601.2a">601.2a</a>–i, except no player receives priority after it’s cast. That spell becomes the topmost object on the stack, and the currently resolving spell or ability continues to resolve, which may include casting other spells this way. No other spells can normally be cast and no other abilities can normally be activated during resolution.</p>
<p><a id="cr608.2h"><b>608.2h</b></a> If an effect requires information from the game (such as the number of creatures on the battlefield), the answer is determined only once, when the effect is applied. If the effect requires information from a specific object, including the source of the ability itself, the effect uses the current information of that object if it’s in the public zone it was expected to be in; if it’s no longer in that zone, or if the effect has moved it from a public zone to a hidden zone, the effect uses the object’s last known information. See rule <a href="#cr113.7a">113.7a</a>. If an ability states that an object does something, it’s the object as it exists—or as it most recently existed—that does it, not the ability.</p>
<p><a id="cr608.2i"><b>608.2i</b></a> If an effect refers to certain characteristics, it checks only for the value of the specified characteristics, regardless of any related ones an object may also have.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> An effect that reads “Destroy all black creatures” destroys a white-and-black creature, but one that reads “Destroy all nonblack creatures” doesn’t.</p>
<p><a id="cr608.2j"><b>608.2j</b></a> If an ability’s effect refers to a specific untargeted object that has been previously referred to by that ability’s cost or trigger condition, it still affects that object even if the object has changed characteristics.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Wall of Tears says “Whenever Wall of Tears blocks a creature, return that creature to its owner’s hand at end of combat.” If Wall of Tears blocks a creature, then that creature ceases to be a creature before the triggered ability resolves, the permanent will still be returned to its owner’s hand.</p>
<p><a id="cr608.2k"><b>608.2k</b></a> If an instant spell, sorcery spell, or ability that can legally resolve leaves the stack once it starts to resolve, it will continue to resolve fully.</p>
<p><a id="cr608.2m"><b>608.2m</b></a> As the final part of an instant or sorcery spell’s resolution, the spell is put into its owner’s graveyard. As the final part of an ability’s resolution, the ability is removed from the stack and ceases to exist.</p>
<p><a id="cr608.3"><b>608.3.</b></a> If the object that’s resolving is a permanent spell, its resolution involves a single step (unless it’s an Aura, a copy of a permanent spell, or a mutating creature spell). The spell card becomes a permanent and is put onto the battlefield under the control of the spell’s controller.</p>
<p><a id="cr608.3a"><b>608.3a</b></a> If the object that’s resolving is an Aura spell, its resolution involves two steps. First, it checks whether the target specified by its enchant ability is still legal, as described in rule <a href="#cr608.2b">608.2b</a>. (See rule <a href="#cr702.5">702.5</a>, “Enchant.”) If so, the spell card becomes a permanent and is put onto the battlefield under the control of the spell’s controller attached to the object it was targeting.</p>
<p><a id="cr608.3b"><b>608.3b</b></a> If the object that’s resolving is a copy of a permanent spell, that object becomes a token permanent and is put onto the battlefield under the control of the spell’s controller. It is no longer a copy of a spell. The token put onto the battlefield this way is not “created” for the purposes of any replacement effects or triggered abilities that refer to creating a token.</p>
<p><a id="cr608.3c"><b>608.3c</b></a> If the object that’s resolving is a mutating creature spell, its resolution involves two steps. First, it checks whether the target creature with the same owner as the spell is still legal. If so, the object representing that spell merges with that permanent. Otherwise, it becomes a creature spell and is put onto the battlefield under the control of the spell’s controller. (See rule <a href="#cr702.140">702.140</a>, “Mutate.”)</p>
<p><a id="cr608.3d"><b>608.3d</b></a> If a permanent spell resolves but its controller can’t put it onto the battlefield, that player puts it into its owner’s graveyard.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Worms of the Earth has the ability “Lands can’t enter the battlefield.” Clone says “You may have Clone enter the battlefield as a copy of any creature on the battlefield.” If a player casts Clone and chooses to copy Dryad Arbor (a land creature) while Worms of the Earth is on the battlefield, Clone can’t enter the battlefield from the stack. It’s put into its owner’s graveyard.</p>
<p><a id="cr609"><b>609. Effects</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr609.1"><b>609.1.</b></a> An effect is something that happens in the game as a result of a spell or ability. When a spell, activated ability, or triggered ability resolves, it may create one or more one-shot or continuous effects. Static abilities may create one or more continuous effects. Text itself is never an effect.</p>
<p><a id="cr609.2"><b>609.2.</b></a> Effects apply only to permanents unless the instruction’s text states otherwise or they clearly can apply only to objects in one or more other zones.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> An effect that changes all lands into creatures won’t alter land cards in players’ graveyards. But an effect that says spells cost more to cast will apply only to spells on the stack, since a spell is always on the stack while a player is casting it.</p>
<p><a id="cr609.3"><b>609.3.</b></a> If an effect attempts to do something impossible, it does only as much as possible.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> If a player is holding only one card, an effect that reads “Discard two cards” causes them to discard only that card. If an effect moves cards out of the library (as opposed to drawing), it moves as many as possible.</p>
<p><a id="cr609.4"><b>609.4.</b></a> Some effects state that a player may do something “as though” some condition were true or a creature can do something “as though” some condition were true. This applies only to the stated effect. For purposes of that effect, treat the game exactly as if the stated condition were true. For all other purposes, treat the game normally.</p>
<p><a id="cr609.4a"><b>609.4a</b></a> If two effects state that a player may (or a creature can) do the same thing “as though” different conditions were true, both conditions could apply. If one “as though” effect satisfies the requirements for another “as though” effect, then both effects will apply.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> A player controls Vedalken Orrery, an artifact that says “You may cast spells as though they had flash.” That player casts Shaman’s Trance, an instant that says, in part, “You may play lands and cast spells from other players’ graveyards this turn as though those cards were in your graveyard.” The player may cast a sorcery with flashback from another player’s graveyard as though it were in that player’s graveyard and as though it had flash.</p>
<p><a id="cr609.4b"><b>609.4b</b></a> If an effect allows a player to spend mana “as though it were mana of any [type or color],” this affects only how the player may pay a cost. It doesn’t change that cost, and it doesn’t change what mana was actually spent to pay that cost.</p>
<p><a id="cr609.5"><b>609.5.</b></a> If an effect could result in a tie, the text of the spell or ability that created the effect will specify what to do in the event of a tie. The Magic game has no default for ties.</p>
<p><a id="cr609.6"><b>609.6.</b></a> Some continuous effects are replacement effects or prevention effects. See rules <a href="#cr614">614</a> and <a href="#cr615.">615.</a></p>
<p><a id="cr609.7"><b>609.7.</b></a> Some effects apply to damage from a source—for example, “The next time a red source of your choice would deal damage to you this turn, prevent that damage.”</p>
<p><a id="cr609.7a"><b>609.7a</b></a> If an effect requires a player to choose a source of damage, they may choose a permanent; a spell on the stack (including a permanent spell); any object referred to by an object on the stack, by a replacement or prevention effect that’s waiting to apply, or by a delayed triggered ability that’s waiting to trigger (even if that object is no longer in the zone it used to be in); or a face-up object in the command zone. A source doesn’t need to be capable of dealing damage to be a legal choice. The source is chosen when the effect is created. If the player chooses a permanent, the effect will apply to the next damage dealt by that permanent, regardless of whether it’s combat damage or damage dealt as the result of a spell or ability. If the player chooses a permanent spell, the effect will apply to any damage dealt by that spell and any damage dealt by the permanent that spell becomes when it resolves.</p>
<p><a id="cr609.7b"><b>609.7b</b></a> Some effects from resolved spells and abilities prevent or replace damage from sources with certain properties, such as a creature or a source of a particular color. When the source would deal damage, the “shield” rechecks the source’s properties. If the properties no longer match, the damage isn’t prevented or replaced. If for any reason the shield prevents no damage or replaces no damage, the shield isn’t used up.</p>
<p><a id="cr609.7c"><b>609.7c</b></a> Some effects from static abilities prevent or replace damage from sources with certain properties. For these effects, the prevention or replacement applies to sources that are permanents with that property and to any sources that aren’t on the battlefield that have that property.</p>
<p><a id="cr609.8"><b>609.8.</b></a> Some effects look back in time and consider previous game states and actions rather than considering the current game state. If such an effect refers to an object or group of objects, those objects don’t need to be currently in the zone they were in at the time of the action, nor do they need to currently meet the criteria described in the action, as long as they did so at the specified time.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> A player attacks with Bear Cub. Later in the turn, an effect causes Bear Cub to become a noncreature permanent. The same player then casts Search Party Captain, a spell that says in part “This spell costs {1} less to cast for each creature you attacked with this turn.” That spell costs {1} less because the player attacked with a creature, even though the Bear Cub they attacked with is no longer a creature.</p>
<p><a id="cr610"><b>610. One-Shot Effects</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr610.1"><b>610.1.</b></a> A one-shot effect does something just once and doesn’t have a duration. Examples include dealing damage, destroying a permanent, creating a token, and moving an object from one zone to another.</p>
<p><a id="cr610.2"><b>610.2.</b></a> Some one-shot effects create a delayed triggered ability, which instructs a player to do something later in the game (usually at a specific time) rather than as the spell or ability that’s creating the one-shot effect resolves. See rule <a href="#cr603.7">603.7</a>.</p>
<p><a id="cr610.3"><b>610.3.</b></a> Some one-shot effects cause an object to change zones “until” a specified event occurs. A second one-shot effect is created immediately after the specified event. This second one-shot effect returns the object to its previous zone.</p>
<p><a id="cr610.3a"><b>610.3a</b></a> If a resolving spell or activated ability creates the initial one-shot effect that causes the object to change zones, and the specified event has already occurred before that one-shot effect would occur but after that spell or ability was put onto the stack, the object doesn’t move.</p>
<p><a id="cr610.3b"><b>610.3b</b></a> If a resolving triggered ability creates the initial one-shot effect that causes the object to change zones, and the specified event has already occurred before that one-shot effect would occur but after that ability triggered, the object doesn’t move.</p>
<p><a id="cr610.3c"><b>610.3c</b></a> An object returned to the battlefield this way returns under its owner’s control unless otherwise specified.</p>
<p><a id="cr610.3d"><b>610.3d</b></a> If multiple one-shot effects are created this way immediately after one or more simultaneous events, those one-shot effects are also simultaneous.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Two Banisher Priests have each exiled a card. All creatures are destroyed at the same time by Day of Judgment. The two exiled cards are returned to the battlefield at the same time.</p>
<p><a id="cr610.4"><b>610.4.</b></a> Some one-shot effects cause a permanent to phase out “until” a specified event occurs. A second one-shot effect is created immediately after the specified event. This second one-shot effect causes the permanent to phase in.</p>
<p><a id="cr610.4a"><b>610.4a</b></a> A permanent phased out this way doesn’t phase in as a result of the turn-based action during a player’s untap step (see rule <a href="#cr502.1">502.1</a>). Other effects may cause it to phase in. If a permanent phased out this way phases in due to another effect, the second one-shot effect doesn’t happen, even if that permanent has phased out again.</p>
<p><a id="cr610.4b"><b>610.4b</b></a> If a resolving spell or activated ability creates the initial one-shot effect that causes the permanent to phase out, and the specified event has already occurred before that one-shot effect would occur but after that spell or ability was put onto the stack, the permanent doesn’t phase out.</p>
<p><a id="cr610.4c"><b>610.4c</b></a> If a resolving triggered ability creates the initial one-shot effect that causes the permanent to phase out, and the specified event has already occurred before that one-shot effect would occur but after that ability triggered, the permanent doesn’t phase out.</p>
<p><a id="cr610.4d"><b>610.4d</b></a> If multiple one-shot effects are created this way immediately after one or more simultaneous events, those one-shot effects are also simultaneous.</p>
<p><a id="cr611"><b>611. Continuous Effects</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr611.1"><b>611.1.</b></a> A continuous effect modifies characteristics of objects, modifies control of objects, or affects players or the rules of the game, for a fixed or indefinite period.</p>
<p><a id="cr611.2"><b>611.2.</b></a> A continuous effect may be generated by the resolution of a spell or ability.</p>
<p><a id="cr611.2a"><b>611.2a</b></a> A continuous effect generated by the resolution of a spell or ability lasts as long as stated by the spell or ability creating it (such as “until end of turn”). If no duration is stated, it lasts until the end of the game.</p>
<p><a id="cr611.2b"><b>611.2b</b></a> Some continuous effects generated by the resolution of a spell or ability have durations worded “for as long as . . . .” If the “for as long as” duration never starts, or it ends before the moment the effect would first be applied, the effect does nothing. It doesn’t start and immediately stop again, and it doesn’t last forever.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Master Thief has the ability “When Master Thief enters the battlefield, gain control of target artifact for as long as you control Master Thief.” If you lose control of Master Thief before the ability resolves, it does nothing, because its duration—as long as you control Master Thief—was over before the effect began.</p>
<p><a id="cr611.2c"><b>611.2c</b></a> If a continuous effect generated by the resolution of a spell or ability modifies the characteristics or changes the controller of any objects, the set of objects it affects is determined when that continuous effect begins. After that point, the set won’t change. (Note that this works differently than a continuous effect from a static ability.) A continuous effect generated by the resolution of a spell or ability that doesn’t modify the characteristics or change the controller of any objects modifies the rules of the game, so it can affect objects that weren’t affected when that continuous effect began. If a single continuous effect has parts that modify the characteristics or changes the controller of any objects and other parts that don’t, the set of objects each part applies to is determined independently.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> An effect that reads “All white creatures get +1/+1 until end of turn” gives the bonus to all permanents that are white creatures when the spell or ability resolves—even if they change color later—and doesn’t affect those that enter the battlefield or turn white afterward.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> An effect that reads “Prevent all damage creatures would deal this turn” doesn’t modify any object’s characteristics, so it’s modifying the rules of the game. That means the effect will apply even to damage from creatures that weren’t on the battlefield when the continuous effect began. It also affects damage from permanents that become creatures later in the turn.</p>
<p><a id="cr611.2d"><b>611.2d</b></a> If a resolving spell or ability that creates a continuous effect contains a variable such as X, the value of that variable is determined only once, on resolution. See rule <a href="#cr608.2h">608.2h</a>.</p>
<p><a id="cr611.2e"><b>611.2e</b></a> If a resolving spell or ability both puts a nontoken permanent onto the battlefield and creates a continuous effect stating that the permanent “is [characteristic],” that continuous effect applies simultaneously with the permanent entering the battlefield. This characteristic is usually a color or a creature type. If the continuous effect says the permanent “becomes [characteristic]” or “gains [an ability],” that effect applies after the permanent is on the battlefield.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Arbiter of the Ideal puts an artifact, creature, or land card onto the battlefield and says, in part, “That permanent is an enchantment in addition to its other types.” An ability that triggers whenever an enchantment enters the battlefield would trigger. The permanent doesn’t enter the battlefield and then become an enchantment.</p>
<p><a id="cr611.3"><b>611.3.</b></a> A continuous effect may be generated by the static ability of an object.</p>
<p><a id="cr611.3a"><b>611.3a</b></a> A continuous effect generated by a static ability isn’t “locked in”; it applies at any given moment to whatever its text indicates.</p>
<p><a id="cr611.3b"><b>611.3b</b></a> The effect applies at all times that the permanent generating it is on the battlefield or the object generating it is in the appropriate zone.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> A permanent with the static ability “All white creatures get +1/+1” generates an effect that continuously gives +1/+1 to each white creature on the battlefield. If a creature becomes white, it gets this bonus; a creature that stops being white loses it.</p>
<p><a id="cr611.3c"><b>611.3c</b></a> Continuous effects that modify characteristics of permanents do so simultaneously with the permanent entering the battlefield. They don’t wait until the permanent is on the battlefield and then change it. Because such effects apply as the permanent enters the battlefield, they are applied before determining whether the permanent will cause an ability to trigger when it enters the battlefield.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> A permanent with the static ability “All white creatures get +1/+1” is on the battlefield. A creature spell that would normally create a 1/1 white creature instead creates a 2/2 white creature. The creature doesn’t enter the battlefield as 1/1 and then change to 2/2.</p>
<p><a id="cr612"><b>612. Text-Changing Effects</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr612.1"><b>612.1.</b></a> Some continuous effects change an object’s text. This can apply to any words or symbols printed on that object, but generally affects only that object’s rules text (which appears in its text box) and/or the text that appears in its type line. Such an effect is a text-changing effect.</p>
<p><a id="cr612.2"><b>612.2.</b></a> A text-changing effect changes only those words that are used in the correct way (for example, a Magic color word being used as a color word, a land type word used as a land type, or a creature type word used as a creature type). An effect that changes a color word or a subtype can’t change a card name, even if that name contains a word or a series of letters that is the same as a Magic color word, basic land type, or creature type.</p>
<p><a id="cr612.2a"><b>612.2a</b></a> Most spells and abilities that create creature tokens use creature types to define both the creature types and the names of the tokens. A text-changing effect that affects such a spell or an object with such an ability can change these words because they’re being used as creature types, even though they’re also being used as names.</p>
<p><a id="cr612.3"><b>612.3.</b></a> Effects that add or remove abilities don’t change the text of the objects they affect, so any abilities that are granted to an object can’t be modified by text-changing effects that affect that object.</p>

<p><a id="cr612.6"><b>612.6.</b></a> One card (Spy Kit) states that an object has “all names of nonlegendary creature cards.” This changes the text that represents the object’s name.

<p><a id="cr613.4a"><b>613.4a</b></a> Layer 7a: Effects from characteristic-defining abilities that define power and/or toughness are applied. See rule <a href="#cr604.3">604.3</a>.</p>
<p><a id="cr613.4b"><b>613.4b</b></a> Layer 7b: Effects that set power and/or toughness to a specific number or value are applied. Effects that refer to the base power and/or toughness of a creature apply in this layer.</p>
<p><a id="cr613.4c"><b>613.4c</b></a> Layer 7c: Effects and counters that modify power and/or toughness (but don’t set power and/or toughness to a specific number or value) are applied.</p>
<p><a id="cr613.4d"><b>613.4d</b></a> Layer 7d: Effects that switch a creature’s power and toughness are applied. Such effects take the value of power and apply it to the creature’s toughness, and take the value of toughness and apply it to the creature’s power.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> A 1/3 creature is given +0/+1 by an effect. Then another effect switches the creature’s power and toughness. Its new power and toughness is 4/1. A new effect gives the creature +5/+0. Its “unswitched” power and toughness would be 6/4, so its actual power and toughness is 4/6.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> A 1/3 creature is given +0/+1 by an effect. Then another effect switches the creature’s power and toughness. Its new power and toughness is 4/1. If the +0/+1 effect ends before the switch effect ends, the creature becomes 3/1.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> A 1/3 creature is given +0/+1 by an effect. Then another effect switches the creature’s power and toughness. Then another effect switches its power and toughness again. The two switches essentially cancel each other, and the creature becomes 1/4.</p>
<p><a href="#com613"><b>★</b></a> <a id="cr613.4e"><b>613.4e</b></a> Layer 7e: Effects that restrict the value of a creature's power and/or toughness are applied. If one of these values would be greater than a set maximum value, less than a set minimum value, or equal to a set replaced value, they become equal to the set value instead.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> A player controls a 2/1 creature and an effect says “Creatures can't have power less than 11.” Its new power and toughness is 11/1.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> A player controls a 2/1 creature and an effect says “Creatures can't have power greater than their toughness.” Its new power and toughness is 1/1.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> A player controls a 2/1 creature and an effect says “Creatures with power 2 have power 3 instead.” Its new power and toughness is 3/1.</p>
<p><a id="cr613.5"><b>613.5.</b></a> The application of continuous effects as described by the layer system is continually and automatically performed by the game. All resulting changes to an object’s characteristics are instantaneous.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Honor of the Pure is an enchantment that reads “White creatures you control get +1/+1.” Honor of the Pure and a 2/2 black creature are on the battlefield under your control. If an effect then turns the creature white (layer 5), it gets +1/+1 from Honor of the Pure (layer 7c), becoming 3/3. If the creature’s color is later changed to red (layer 5), Honor of the Pure’s effect stops applying to it, and it will return to being 2/2.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Gray Ogre, a 2/2 creature, is on the battlefield. An effect puts a +1/+1 counter on it (layer 7d), making it 3/3. A spell targeting it that says “Target creature gets +4/+4 until end of turn” resolves (layer 7c), making it 7/7. An enchantment that says “Creatures you control get +0/+2” enters the battlefield (layer 7c), making it 7/9. An effect that says “Target creature becomes 0/1 until end of turn” is applied to it (layer 7b), making it 5/8 (0/1, with +4/+4 from the resolved spell, +0/+2 from the enchantment, and +1/+1 from the counter).</p>
<p><a id="cr613.6"><b>613.6.</b></a> If an effect should be applied in different layers and/or sublayers, the parts of the effect each apply in their appropriate ones. If an effect starts to apply in one layer and/or sublayer, it will continue to be applied to the same set of objects in each other applicable layer and/or sublayer, even if the ability generating the effect is removed during this process.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> An effect that reads “Wild Mongrel gets +1/+1 and becomes the color of your choice until end of turn” is both a power- and toughness-changing effect and a color-changing effect. The “becomes the color of your choice” part is applied in layer 5, and then the “gets +1/+1” part is applied in layer 7c.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Act of Treason has an effect that reads “Gain control of target creature until end of turn. Untap that creature. It gains haste until end of turn.” This is both a control-changing effect and an effect that adds an ability to an object. The “gain control” part is applied in layer 2, and then the “it gains haste” part is applied in layer 6.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> An effect that reads “All noncreature artifacts become 2/2 artifact creatures until end of turn” is both a type-changing effect and a power- and toughness-setting effect. The type-changing effect is applied to all noncreature artifacts in layer 4 and the power- and toughness-setting effect is applied to those same permanents in layer 7b, even though those permanents aren’t noncreature artifacts by then.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Svogthos, the Restless Tomb, is on the battlefield. An effect that says “Until end of turn, target land becomes a 3/3 creature that’s still a land” is applied to it (layers 4 and 7b). An effect that says “Target creature gets +1/+1 until end of turn” is applied to it (layer 7c), making it a 4/4 land creature. Then while you have ten creature cards in your graveyard, you activate Svogthos’s ability: “Until end of turn, Svogthos, the Restless Tomb becomes a black and green Plant Zombie creature with ‘This creature’s power and toughness are each equal to the number of creature cards in your graveyard.’ It’s still a land.” (layers 4, 5, and 7b). It becomes an 11/11 land creature. If a creature card enters or leaves your graveyard, Svogthos’s power and toughness will be modified accordingly. If the first effect is applied to it again, it will become a 4/4 land creature again.</p>
<p><a id="cr613.7"><b>613.7.</b></a> Within a layer or sublayer, determining which order effects are applied in is usually done using a timestamp system. An effect with an earlier timestamp is applied before an effect with a later timestamp.</p>
<p><a id="cr613.7a"><b>613.7a</b></a> A continuous effect generated by a static ability has the same timestamp as the object the static ability is on, or the timestamp of the effect that created the ability, whichever is later. If the effect that created the ability has the later timestamp and the object the ability is on receives a new timestamp, each continuous effect generated by static abilities of that object receives a new timestamp as well, but the relative order of those timestamps remains the same.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Rune of Flight is an Aura that grants enchanted Equipment “Equipped creature has flying.” A player attaches Rune of Flight to Colossus Hammer, an Equipment with “Equipped creature gets +10/+10 and loses flying.” The ability granted by Rune of Flight shares Rune of Flight’s timestamp because it is later than Colossus Hammer’s timestamp. If Colossus Hammer becomes attached to a creature, both of its abilities receive new timestamps (see rule <a href="#cr613.7e">613.7e</a>), but the relative order of those timestamps remains the same.</p>
<p><a id="cr613.7b"><b>613.7b</b></a> A continuous effect generated by the resolution of a spell or ability receives a timestamp at the time it’s created.</p>
<p><a id="cr613.7c"><b>613.7c</b></a> Each counter receives a timestamp as it’s put on an object or player. If that object or player already has a counter of that kind on it, each counter of that kind receives a new timestamp identical to that of the new counter.</p>
<p><a id="cr613.7d"><b>613.7d</b></a> An object receives a timestamp at the time it enters a zone.</p>
<p><a id="cr613.7e"><b>613.7e</b></a> An Aura, Equipment, or Fortification receives a new timestamp each time it becomes attached to an object or player.</p>
<p><a id="cr613.7f"><b>613.7f</b></a> A permanent receives a new timestamp each time it turns face up or face down.</p>
<p><a id="cr613.7g"><b>613.7g</b></a> A transforming double-faced permanent receives a new timestamp each time it transforms.</p>
<p><a id="cr613.7h"><b>613.7h</b></a> A face-up plane card, phenomenon card, or scheme card receives a timestamp at the time it’s turned face up.</p>
<p><a id="cr613.7i"><b>613.7i</b></a> A face-up vanguard card receives a timestamp at the beginning of the game.</p>
<p><a id="cr613.7j"><b>613.7j</b></a> A conspiracy card receives a timestamp at the beginning of the game. If it’s face down, it receives a new timestamp at the time it turns face up.</p>
<p><a id="cr613.7k"><b>613.7k</b></a> If two or more objects would receive a timestamp simultaneously, such as by entering a zone simultaneously or becoming attached simultaneously, their relative timestamps are determined in APNAP order (see rule <a href="#cr101.4">101.4</a>). Objects controlled by the active player (or owned by the active player, if they have no controller) have an earlier relative timestamp in the order of that player’s choice, followed by each other player in turn order.</p>
<p><a id="cr613.8"><b>613.8.</b></a> Within a layer or sublayer, determining which order effects are applied in is sometimes done using a dependency system. If a dependency exists, it will override the timestamp system.</p>
<p><a id="cr613.8a"><b>613.8a</b></a> An effect is said to “depend on” another if (a) it’s applied in the same layer (and, if applicable, sublayer) as the other effect; (b) applying the other would change the text or the existence of the first effect, what it applies to, or what it does to any of the things it applies to; and (c) neither effect is from a characteristic-defining ability or both effects are from characteristic-defining abilities. Otherwise, the effect is considered to be independent of the other effect.</p>
<p><a id="cr613.8b"><b>613.8b</b></a> An effect dependent on one or more other effects waits to apply until just after all of those effects have been applied. If multiple dependent effects would apply simultaneously in this way, they’re applied in timestamp order relative to each other. If several dependent effects form a dependency loop, then this rule is ignored and the effects in the dependency loop are applied in timestamp order.</p>
<p><a id="cr613.8c"><b>613.8c</b></a> After each effect is applied, the order of remaining effects is reevaluated and may change if an effect that has not yet been applied becomes dependent on or independent of one or more other effects that have not yet been applied.</p>
<p><a id="cr613.9"><b>613.9.</b></a> One continuous effect can override another. Sometimes the results of one effect determine whether another effect applies or what another effect does.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Two effects are affecting the same creature: one from an Aura that says “Enchanted creature has flying” and one from an Aura that says “Enchanted creature loses flying.” Neither of these depends on the other, since nothing changes what they affect or what they’re doing to it. Applying them in timestamp order means the one that was generated last “wins.” The same process would be followed, and the same result reached, if either of the effects had a duration (such as “Target creature loses flying until end of turn”) or came from a non-Aura source (such as “All creatures lose flying”).<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> One effect reads, “White creatures get +1/+1,” and another reads, “Enchanted creature is white.” The enchanted creature gets +1/+1 from the first effect, regardless of its previous color.</p>
<p><a id="cr613.10"><b>613.10.</b></a> Some continuous effects affect players rather than objects. For example, an effect might give a player protection from red. All such effects are applied in timestamp order after the determination of objects’ characteristics. See also the rules for timestamp order and dependency (rules <a href="#cr613.7">613.7</a> and <a href="#cr613.8">613.8</a>).</p>
<p><a id="cr613.11"><b>613.11.</b></a> Some continuous effects affect game rules rather than objects. For example, effects may modify a player’s maximum hand size, or say that a creature must attack this turn if able. These effects are applied after all other continuous effects have been applied. Continuous effects that affect the costs of spells or abilities are applied according to the order specified in rule <a href="#cr601.2f">601.2f</a>. All other such effects are applied in timestamp order. See also the rules for timestamp order and dependency (rules <a href="#cr613.7">613.7</a> and <a href="#cr613.8">613.8</a>).</p>
<p><a id="cr614"><b>614. Replacement Effects</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr614.1"><b>614.1.</b></a> Some continuous effects are replacement effects. Like prevention effects (see rule <a href="#cr615">615</a>), replacement effects apply continuously as events happen—they aren’t locked in ahead of time. Such effects watch for a particular event that would happen and completely or partially replace that event with a different event. They act like “shields” around whatever they’re affecting.</p>
<p><a id="cr614.1a"><b>614.1a</b></a> Effects that use the word “instead” are replacement effects. Most replacement effects use the word “instead” to indicate what events will be replaced with other events.</p>
<p><a id="cr614.1b"><b>614.1b</b></a> Effects that use the word “skip” are replacement effects. These replacement effects use the word “skip” to indicate what events, steps, phases, or turns will be replaced with nothing.</p>
<p><a id="cr614.1c"><b>614.1c</b></a> Effects that read “[This permanent] enters the battlefield with . . . ,” “As [this permanent] enters the battlefield . . . ,” or “[This permanent] enters the battlefield as . . . “ are replacement effects.</p>
<p><a id="cr614.1d"><b>614.1d</b></a> Continuous effects that read “[This permanent] enters the battlefield . . .” or “[Objects] enter the battlefield . . .” are replacement effects.</p>
<p><a id="cr614.1e"><b>614.1e</b></a> Effects that read “As [this permanent] is turned face up . . . ,” are replacement effects.</p>
<p><a id="cr614.2"><b>614.2.</b></a> Some replacement effects apply to damage from a source. See rule <a href="#cr609.7">609.7</a>.</p>
<p><a id="cr614.3"><b>614.3.</b></a> There are no special restrictions on casting a spell or activating an ability that generates a replacement effect. Such effects last until they’re used up or their duration has expired.</p>
<p><a id="cr614.4"><b>614.4.</b></a> Replacement effects must exist before the appropriate event occurs—they can’t “go back in time” and change something that’s already happened. Spells or abilities that generate these effects are often cast or activated in response to whatever would produce the event and thus resolve before that event would occur.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> A player can activate an ability to regenerate a creature in response to a spell that would destroy it. Once the spell resolves, though, it’s too late to regenerate the creature.</p>
<p><a id="cr614.5"><b>614.5.</b></a> A replacement effect doesn’t invoke itself repeatedly; it gets only one opportunity to affect an event or any modified events that may replace that event.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> A player controls two permanents, each with an ability that reads “If a creature you control would deal damage to a permanent or player, it deals double that damage to that permanent or player instead.” A creature that normally deals 2 damage will deal 8 damage—not just 4, and not an infinite amount.</p>
<p><a id="cr614.6"><b>614.6.</b></a> If an event is replaced, it never happens. A modified event occurs instead, which may in turn trigger abilities. Note that the modified event may contain instructions that can’t be carried out, in which case the impossible instruction is simply ignored.</p>
<p><a id="cr614.7"><b>614.7.</b></a> If a replacement effect would replace an event, but that event never happens, the replacement effect simply doesn’t do anything.</p>
<p><a id="cr614.7a"><b>614.7a</b></a> If a source would deal 0 damage, it does not deal damage at all. Replacement effects that would increase the damage dealt by that source, or would have that source deal that damage to a different object or player, have no event to replace, so they have no effect.</p>
<p><a id="cr614.8"><b>614.8.</b></a> Regeneration is a destruction-replacement effect. The word “instead” doesn’t appear on the card but is implicit in the definition of regeneration. “Regenerate [permanent]” means “The next time [permanent] would be destroyed this turn, instead remove all damage marked on it and tap it. If it’s an attacking or blocking creature, remove it from combat.” Abilities that trigger from damage being dealt still trigger even if the permanent regenerates. See rule <a href="#cr701.15">701.15</a>.</p>
<p><a id="cr614.9"><b>614.9.</b></a> Some effects replace damage dealt to one creature, planeswalker, or player with the same damage dealt to another creature, planeswalker, or player; such effects are called redirection effects. If either creature or planeswalker is no longer on the battlefield when the damage would be redirected, or is no longer a creature or planeswalker when the damage would be redirected, the effect does nothing. If damage would be redirected to or from a player who has left the game, the effect does nothing.</p>
<p><a id="cr614.10"><b>614.10.</b></a> An effect that causes a player to skip an event, step, phase, or turn is a replacement effect. “Skip [something]” is the same as “Instead of doing [something], do nothing.” Once a step, phase, or turn has started, it can no longer be skipped—any skip effects will wait until the next occurrence.</p>
<p><a id="cr614.10a"><b>614.10a</b></a> Anything scheduled for a skipped step, phase, or turn won’t happen. Anything scheduled for the “next” occurrence of something waits for the first occurrence that isn’t skipped. If two effects each cause a player to skip their next occurrence, that player must skip the next two; one effect will be satisfied in skipping the first occurrence, while the other will remain until another occurrence can be skipped.</p>
<p><a id="cr614.10b"><b>614.10b</b></a> Some effects cause a player to skip a step, phase, or turn, then take another action. That action is considered to be the first thing that happens during the next step, phase, or turn to actually occur.</p>
<p><a id="cr614.11"><b>614.11.</b></a> Some effects replace card draws. These effects are applied even if no cards could be drawn because there are no cards in the affected player’s library.</p>
<p><a id="cr614.11a"><b>614.11a</b></a> If an effect replaces a draw within a sequence of card draws, all actions required by the replacement are completed, if possible, before resuming the sequence.</p>
<p><a id="cr614.11b"><b>614.11b</b></a> If an effect would have a player both draw a card and perform an additional action on that card, and the draw is replaced, the additional action is not performed on any cards that are drawn as a result of that replacement effect.</p>
<p><a id="cr614.12"><b>614.12.</b></a> Some replacement effects modify how a permanent enters the battlefield. (See rules <a href="#cr614.1c">614.1c</a>–d.) Such effects may come from the permanent itself if they affect only that permanent (as opposed to a general subset of permanents that includes it). They may also come from other sources. To determine which replacement effects apply and how they apply, check the characteristics of the permanent as it would exist on the battlefield, taking into account replacement effects that have already modified how it enters the battlefield (see rule <a href="#cr616.1">616.1</a>), continuous effects from the permanent’s own static abilities that would apply to it once it’s on the battlefield, and continuous effects that already exist and would apply to the permanent.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Voice of All says “As Voice of All enters the battlefield, choose a color” and “Voice of All has protection from the chosen color.” An effect creates a token that’s a copy of Voice of All. As that token is created, the token’s controller chooses a color for it.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Yixlid Jailer says “Cards in graveyards lose all abilities.” Scarwood Treefolk says “Scarwood Treefolk enters the battlefield tapped.” A Scarwood Treefolk that’s put onto the battlefield from a graveyard enters the battlefield tapped.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Orb of Dreams is an artifact that says “Permanents enter the battlefield tapped.” It won’t affect itself, so Orb of Dreams enters the battlefield untapped.</p>
<p><a id="cr614.12a"><b>614.12a</b></a> If a replacement effect that modifies how a permanent enters the battlefield requires a choice, that choice is made before the permanent enters the battlefield.</p>
<p><a id="cr614.12b"><b>614.12b</b></a> Some replacement effects cause a permanent to enter the battlefield with its controller’s choice of one of two abilities, each marked with an anchor word and preceded by a bullet point. “[Anchor word] — [ability]” means “As long as [anchor word] was chosen as this permanent entered the battlefield, this permanent has [ability].” The abilities preceded by anchor words are each linked to the ability that causes a player to choose between them. See rule <a href="#cr607">607</a>, “Linked Abilities.”</p>
<p><a id="cr614.13"><b>614.13.</b></a> An effect that modifies how a permanent enters the battlefield may cause other objects to change zones.</p>
<p><a id="cr614.13a"><b>614.13a</b></a> While applying an effect that modifies how a permanent enters the battlefield, you may have to choose a number of objects that will also change zones. You can’t choose the object that will become that permanent or any other object entering the battlefield at the same time as that object.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Sutured Ghoul says, in part, “As Sutured Ghoul enters the battlefield, exile any number of creature cards from your graveyard.” If Sutured Ghoul and Runeclaw Bear enter the battlefield from your graveyard at the same time, you can’t choose to exile either of them when applying Sutured Ghoul’s replacement effect.</p>
<p><a id="cr614.13b"><b>614.13b</b></a> The same object can’t be chosen to change zones more than once when applying replacement effects that modify how a single permanent enters the battlefield.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Jund (a plane card) says, “Whenever a player casts a black, red, or green creature spell, it gains devour 5.” A player controls Runeclaw Bear and casts Thunder-Thrash Elder, a red creature spell with devour 3. As Thunder-Thrash Elder enters the battlefield, its controller can choose to sacrifice Runeclaw Bear when applying the devour 3 effect or when applying the devour 5 effect, but not both. Thunder-Thrash Elder will enter the battlefield with zero, three, or five +1/+1 counters, depending on this choice.</p>
<p><a id="cr614.14"><b>614.14.</b></a> An object may have one ability printed on it that generates a replacement effect which causes one or more cards to be exiled, and another ability that refers either to “the exiled cards” or to cards “exiled with [this object].” These abilities are linked: the second refers only to cards in the exile zone that were put there as a direct result of the replacement event caused by the first. If another object gains a pair of linked abilities, the abilities will be similarly linked on that object. They can’t be linked to any other ability, regardless of what other abilities the object may currently have or may have had in the past. See rule <a href="#cr607">607</a>, “Linked Abilities.”</p>
<p><a id="cr614.15"><b>614.15.</b></a> Some replacement effects are not continuous effects. Rather, they are an effect of a resolving spell or ability that replace part or all of that spell or ability’s own effect(s). Such effects are called self-replacement effects. The text creating a self-replacement effect is usually part of the ability whose effect is being replaced, but the text can be a separate ability, particularly when preceded by an ability word. When applying replacement effects to an event, self-replacement effects are applied before other replacement effects.</p>
<p><a id="cr614.16"><b>614.16.</b></a> Some replacement effects apply “if an effect would create one or more tokens” or “if an effect would put one or more counters on a permanent.” These replacement effects apply if the effect of a resolving spell or ability creates a token or puts a counter on a permanent, and they also apply if another replacement or prevention effect does so, even if the original event being modified wasn’t itself an effect. </p>
<p><a id="cr614.17"><b>614.17.</b></a> Some effects state that something can’t happen. These effects aren’t replacement effects, but follow similar rules.</p>
<p><a id="cr614.17a"><b>614.17a</b></a> “Can’t” effects must exist before the appropriate event occurs—they can’t “go back in time” and change something that’s already happened.</p>
<p><a id="cr614.17b"><b>614.17b</b></a> If an event can’t happen, a player can’t choose to pay a cost that includes that event.</p>
<p><a id="cr614.17c"><b>614.17c</b></a> If an event can’t happen, it can only be replaced by a self-replacement effect (see rule <a href="#cr614.15">614.15</a>). Other replacement and/or prevention effects can’t modify or replace it.</p>
<p><a id="cr614.17d"><b>614.17d</b></a> Some “can’t” effects modify how a permanent enters the battlefield or whether it can enter the battlefield. Such effects may come from the permanent itself if they affect only that permanent (as opposed to a general subset of permanents that includes it). They may also come from other sources. To determine which “can’t” effects apply, check the characteristics of the permanent as it would exist on the battlefield, taking into account replacement effects that have already modified how it enters the battlefield (see rule <a href="#cr616.1">616.1</a>), continuous effects from the permanent’s own static abilities that would apply to it once it’s on the battlefield, and continuous effects that already exist and would apply to the permanent.</p>
<p><a id="cr615"><b>615. Prevention Effects</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr615.1"><b>615.1.</b></a> Some continuous effects are prevention effects. Like replacement effects (see rule <a href="#cr614">614</a>), prevention effects apply continuously as events happen—they aren’t locked in ahead of time. Such effects watch for a damage event that would happen and completely or partially prevent the damage that would be dealt. They act like “shields” around whatever they’re affecting.</p>
<p><a id="cr615.1a"><b>615.1a</b></a> Effects that use the word “prevent” are prevention effects. Prevention effects use “prevent” to indicate what damage will not be dealt.</p>
<p><a id="cr615.2"><b>615.2.</b></a> Many prevention effects apply to damage from a source. See rule <a href="#cr609.7">609.7</a>.</p>
<p><a id="cr615.3"><b>615.3.</b></a> There are no special restrictions on casting a spell or activating an ability that generates a prevention effect. Such effects last until they’re used up or their duration has expired.</p>
<p><a id="cr615.4"><b>615.4.</b></a> Prevention effects must exist before the appropriate damage event occurs—they can’t “go back in time” and change something that’s already happened. Spells or abilities that generate these effects are often cast or activated in response to whatever would produce the event and thus resolve before that event would occur.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> A player can activate an ability that prevents damage in response to a spell that would deal damage. Once the spell resolves, though, it’s too late to prevent the damage.</p>
<p><a id="cr615.5"><b>615.5.</b></a> Some prevention effects also include an additional effect, which may refer to the amount of damage that was prevented. The prevention takes place at the time the original event would have happened; the rest of the effect takes place immediately afterward.</p>
<p><a id="cr615.6"><b>615.6.</b></a> If damage that would be dealt is prevented, it never happens. A modified event may occur instead, which may in turn trigger abilities. Note that the modified event may contain instructions that can’t be carried out, in which case the impossible instruction is simply ignored.</p>
<p><a id="cr615.7"><b>615.7.</b></a> Some prevention effects generated by the resolution of a spell or ability refer to a specific amount of damage—for example, “Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn.” These work like shields. Each 1 damage that would be dealt to the “shielded” permanent or player is prevented. Preventing 1 damage reduces the remaining shield by 1. If damage would be dealt to the shielded permanent or player by two or more applicable sources at the same time, the player or the controller of the permanent chooses which damage the shield prevents. Once the shield has been reduced to 0, any remaining damage is dealt normally. Such effects count only the amount of damage; the number of events or sources dealing it doesn’t matter.</p>
<p><a id="cr615.8"><b>615.8.</b></a> Some prevention effects generated by the resolution of a spell or ability refer to the next time a specific source would deal damage. These effects prevent the next instance of damage from that source, regardless of how much damage that is. Once an instance of damage from that source has been prevented, any subsequent instances of damage that would be dealt by that source are dealt normally.</p>
<p><a id="cr615.9"><b>615.9.</b></a> Some effects generated by the resolution of a spell or ability prevent damage from a source of a player’s choice with certain properties. When the source would deal damage, the shield rechecks the source’s properties. If the properties no longer match, the damage isn’t prevented or replaced and the shield isn’t used up. See rule <a href="#cr609.7b">609.7b</a>.</p>
<p><a id="cr615.10"><b>615.10.</b></a> Some prevention effects generated by static abilities refer to a specific amount of damage—for example, “If a source would deal damage to you, prevent 1 of that damage.” Such an effect prevents only the indicated amount of damage in any applicable damage event at any given time. It will apply separately to damage from other applicable events that would happen at the same time, or at a different time.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Daunting Defender says “If a source would deal damage to a Cleric creature you control, prevent 1 of that damage.” Pyroclasm says “Pyroclasm deals 2 damage to each creature.” Pyroclasm will deal 1 damage to each Cleric creature controlled by Daunting Defender’s controller. It will deal 2 damage to each other creature.</p>
<p><a id="cr615.11"><b>615.11.</b></a> Some prevention effects prevent the next N damage that would be dealt to each of a number of untargeted creatures. Such an effect creates a prevention shield for each applicable creature when the spell or ability that generates that effect resolves.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Wojek Apothecary has an ability that says “{T}: Prevent the next 1 damage that would be dealt to target creature and each other creature that shares a color with it this turn.” When the ability resolves, it gives the target creature and each other creature on the battlefield that shares a color with it at that time a shield preventing the next 1 damage that would be dealt to it. Changing creatures’ colors after the ability resolves doesn’t add or remove shields, and creatures that enter the battlefield later in the turn don’t get the shield.</p>
<p><a id="cr615.12"><b>615.12.</b></a> Some effects state that damage “can’t be prevented.” If unpreventable damage would be dealt, any applicable prevention effects are still applied to it. Those effects won’t prevent any damage, but any additional effects they have will take place. Existing damage prevention shields won’t be reduced by damage that can’t be prevented.</p>
<p><a id="cr615.12a"><b>615.12a</b></a> A prevention effect is applied to any particular unpreventable damage event just once. It won’t invoke itself repeatedly trying to prevent that damage.</p>
<p><a id="cr615.13"><b>615.13.</b></a> Some triggered abilities trigger when damage that would be dealt is prevented. Such an ability triggers each time a prevention effect is applied to one or more simultaneous damage events and prevents some or all of that damage.</p>
<p><a id="cr616"><b>616. Interaction of Replacement and/or Prevention Effects</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr616.1"><b>616.1.</b></a> If two or more replacement and/or prevention effects are attempting to modify the way an event affects an object or player, the affected object’s controller (or its owner if it has no controller) or the affected player chooses one to apply, following the steps listed below. If two or more players have to make these choices at the same time, choices are made in APNAP order (see rule <a href="#cr101.4">101.4</a>).</p>
<p><a id="cr616.1a"><b>616.1a</b></a> If any of the replacement and/or prevention effects are self-replacement effects (see rule <a href="#cr614.15">614.15</a>), one of them must be chosen. If not, proceed to rule <a href="#cr616.1b">616.1b</a>.</p>
<p><a id="cr616.1b"><b>616.1b</b></a> If any of the replacement and/or prevention effects would modify under whose control an object would enter the battlefield, one of them must be chosen. If not, proceed to rule <a href="#cr616.1c">616.1c</a>.</p>
<p><a id="cr616.1c"><b>616.1c</b></a> If any of the replacement and/or prevention effects would cause an object to become a copy of another object as it enters the battlefield, one of them must be chosen. If not, proceed to rule <a href="#cr616.1d">616.1d</a>.</p>
<p><a id="cr616.1d"><b>616.1d</b></a> If any of the replacement and/or prevention effects would cause a card to enter the battlefield with its back face up, one of them must be chosen (See rule <a href="#cr701.28">701.28</a>, “Transform”). If not, proceed to 616.1e.</p>
<p><a id="cr616.1e"><b>616.1e</b></a> Any of the applicable replacement and/or prevention effects may be chosen.</p>
<p><a id="cr616.1f"><b>616.1f</b></a> Once the chosen effect has been applied, this process is repeated (taking into account only replacement or prevention effects that would now be applicable) until there are no more left to apply.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Two permanents are on the battlefield. One is an enchantment that reads “If a card would be put into a graveyard from anywhere, instead exile it,” and the other is a creature that reads “If [this creature] would die, instead shuffle it into its owner’s library.” If the creature is destroyed, its controller decides which replacement to apply first; the other does nothing.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Essence of the Wild reads “Creatures you control enter the battlefield as a copy of Essence of the Wild.” A player who controls Essence of the Wild casts Rusted Sentinel, which normally enters the battlefield tapped. As it enters the battlefield, the copy effect from Essence of the Wild is applied first. As a result, it no longer has the ability that causes it to enter the battlefield tapped. Rusted Sentinel will enter the battlefield as an untapped copy of Essence of the Wild.</p>
<p><a id="cr616.1g"><b>616.1g</b></a> While following the steps in 616.1a–f, one replacement or prevention effect may apply to an event, and another may apply to an event contained within the first event. In this case, the second effect can’t be chosen until after the first effect has been chosen.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> A player is instructed to create a token that’s a copy of Voice of All, which has the ability “As Voice of All enters the battlefield, choose a color.” Doubling Season has an ability that reads “If an effect would create one or more tokens under your control, it creates twice that many of those tokens instead.” Because entering the battlefield is an event contained within the event of creating a token, the effect of Doubling Season must be applied first, and then the effects of the two Voice of All tokens may be applied in either order.</p>
<p><a id="cr616.2"><b>616.2.</b></a> A replacement or prevention effect can become applicable to an event as the result of another replacement or prevention effect that modifies the event.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> One effect reads “If you would gain life, draw that many cards instead,” and another reads “If you would draw a card, return a card from your graveyard to your hand instead.” Both effects combine (regardless of the order they came into existence): Instead of gaining 1 life, the player puts a card from their graveyard into their hand.</p>
<a id="cr7"><b>7. Additional Rules</b></a><p><a id="cr700"><b>700. General</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr700.1"><b>700.1.</b></a> Anything that happens in a game is an event. Multiple events may take place during the resolution of a spell or ability. The text of triggered abilities and replacement effects defines the event they’re looking for. One “happening” may be treated as a single event by one ability and as multiple events by another.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> If an attacking creature is blocked by two creatures, this is one event for a triggered ability that reads “Whenever [this creature] becomes blocked” but two events for a triggered ability that reads “Whenever [this creature] becomes blocked by a creature.”</p>
<p><a href="#com700.2"><b>★</b></a> <a id="cr700.2"><b>700.2.</b></a> A spell or ability is modal if it has two or more options in a bulleted list preceded by instructions for a player to choose a number of those options, such as “Choose one --.” A card is modal if one of its spell abilities are modal. Each of those options is a mode.</p>
<p><a id="cr700.3"><b>700.3.</b></a> Some effects cause objects to be temporarily grouped into piles.</p>
<p><a id="cr700.3a"><b>700.3a</b></a> Each of the affected objects must be put into exactly one of those piles, unless the effect specifies otherwise.</p>
<p><a id="cr700.3b"><b>700.3b</b></a> Each object in a pile is still an individual object. The pile is not an object.</p>
<p><a id="cr700.3c"><b>700.3c</b></a> Objects grouped into piles don’t leave the zone they’re currently in. If cards in a graveyard are split into piles, the order of the graveyard must be maintained.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Fact or Fiction reads, “Reveal the top five cards of your library. An opponent separates those cards into two piles. Put one pile into your hand and the other into your graveyard.” While an opponent is separating the revealed cards into piles, they’re still in their owner’s library. They don’t leave the library until they’re put into their owner’s hand or graveyard.</p>
<p><a id="cr700.3d"><b>700.3d</b></a> A pile can contain zero or more objects.</p>
<p><a id="cr700.4"><b>700.4.</b></a> The term dies means “is put into a graveyard from the battlefield.”</p>
<p><a id="cr700.5"><b>700.5.</b></a> A player’s devotion to [color] is equal to the number of mana symbols of that color among the mana costs of permanents that player controls. A player’s devotion to [color 1] and [color 2] is equal to the number of mana symbols among the mana costs of permanents that player controls that are [color 1], [color 2], or both colors.</p>
<p><a id="cr700.5a"><b>700.5a</b></a> A player’s devotion to each color and combination of colors, taking into account any effects that modify devotion, is calculated after considering any copy, control, or text-changing effects but before any other effects that modify the characteristics of permanents. This is an exception to 613.10. See also rule <a href="#cr613">613</a>, “Interaction of Continuous Effects.”<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Altar of the Pantheon is an artifact with no colored mana in its cost and an ability that says “Your devotion to each color and each combination of colors is increased by one.” Purphoros, God of the Forge is a permanent mana cost {3}{R} and an ability that says “As long as your devotion to red is less than five, Purphoros isn’t a creature.” If a player controls both of these permanents and another permanent that costs {R}{R}{R}, that player’s devotion to red is calculated to be five before Purphoros’s type-changing effect is applied, and Purphoros is a creature.</p>
<p><a id="cr700.6"><b>700.6.</b></a> The term historic refers to an object that has the legendary supertype, the artifact card type, or the Saga subtype.</p>
<p><a id="cr700.7"><b>700.7.</b></a> If an ability uses a phrase such as “this [something]” to identify an object, where [something] is a characteristic, it is referring to that particular object, even if it isn’t the appropriate characteristic at the time.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> An ability reads “Target creature gets +2/+2 until end of turn. Destroy that creature at the beginning of the next end step.” The ability will destroy the object it gave +2/+2 to even if that object isn’t a creature at the beginning of the next end step.</p>
<p><a id="cr700.8"><b>700.8.</b></a> Some cards refer to the number of creatures in a player’s party. A player’s party consists of up to one creature that player controls for each of the following four creature types: Cleric, Rogue, Warrior, and Wizard.</p>
<p><a id="cr700.8a"><b>700.8a</b></a> The calculation of the number of creatures in a player’s party is performed automatically by the game and results in a number between zero and four. Players don’t declare which specific creatures they control are in their party.</p>
<p><a id="cr700.8b"><b>700.8b</b></a> If a creature has multiple creature types for which it could be the party member, it is counted as the party member for only one of those types. If there are different ways to count such a creature that results in different numbers of creatures in a player’s party, it is counted in such a way to get the highest result.</p>
<p><a id="cr700.8c"><b>700.8c</b></a> A player has a full party if there are four creatures in that player’s party.</p>
<p><a id="cr700.9"><b>700.9.</b></a> Some cards refer to modified creatures. A creature is modified if it has one or more counters on it (see rule <a href="#cr122">122</a>), if it is equipped (see rule <a href="#cr301.5">301.5</a>), or if it is enchanted by an Aura that is controlled by that creature’s controller. (see rule <a href="#cr303.4">303.4</a>). If an ability of a permanent checks to see whether that permanent is modified, the answer is always no if that permanent isn’t a currently a creature.</p>
<p><b>★</b> <a id="cr700.10"><b>700.10.</b></a> After damage is dealt to a creature and state-based actions have been performed, that creature “perseveres” if it is still on the battlefield.</p>
<p><b>★</b> <a id="cr700.11"><b>700.11.</b></a> A creature is “embattled” if that creature has a counter on it or that creature has a permanent with the same controller attached to it.</p>
<p><b>★</b> <a id="cr700.12"><b>700.12.</b></a> The term “storied” refers to an object that has the legendary supertype or the enchantment card type.</p>
<p><b>★</b> <a id="cr700.13"><b>700.13.</b></a> A player's fealty to (type) is equal to the number of (type) permanents that player controls.</p>
<p><b>★</b> <a id="cr700.14"><b>700.14.</b></a> A player is “cursed” if they are being enchanted by a Curse Aura. Auras enchanting a player without the Curse subtype have no bearing on if a player is cursed.</p>
<p><b>★</b> <a id="cr700.15"><b>700.15.</b></a> The term “cyptic” refers to an object that has the artifact or enchantment card type, or is an instant or sorcery card that is modal.</p>
<p><b>★</b> <a id="cr700.16"><b>700.16.</b></a> A player “innovates” as they cast a spell except for the first one they cast each turn, draw a card except for the first one they draw in a turn, or a land enters the battlefield under their control except for the first one that enters the battlefield under their control each turn.</p>
<p><b>★</b> <a id="cr700.17"><b>700.17.</b></a> The term “in your portfolio” refers to Advisors, artifacts, and enchantments you control.</p>
<p><a id="cr701"><b>701. Keyword Actions</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr701.1"><b>701.1.</b></a> Most actions described in a card’s rules text use the standard English definitions of the verbs within, but some specialized verbs are used whose meanings may not be clear. These “keywords” are game terms; sometimes reminder text summarizes their meanings.</p>
<p><a id="cr701.2"><b>701.2.</b></a> Activate</p>
<p><a id="cr701.2a"><b>701.2a</b></a> To activate an activated ability is to put it onto the stack and pay its costs, so that it will eventually resolve and have its effect. Only an object’s controller (or its owner, if it doesn’t have a controller) can activate its activated ability unless the object specifically says otherwise. A player may activate an ability if they have priority. See rule <a href="#cr602">602</a>, “Activating Activated Abilities.”</p>
<p><a id="cr701.3"><b>701.3.</b></a> Attach</p>
<p><a id="cr701.3a"><b>701.3a</b></a> To attach an Aura, Equipment, or Fortification to an object or player means to take it from where it currently is and put it onto that object or player. If something is attached to a permanent on the battlefield, it’s customary to place it so that it’s physically touching the permanent. An Aura, Equipment, or Fortification can’t be attached to an object or player it couldn’t enchant, equip, or fortify, respectively.</p>
<p><a id="cr701.3b"><b>701.3b</b></a> If an effect tries to attach an Aura, Equipment, or Fortification to an object or player it can’t be attached to, the Aura, Equipment, or Fortification doesn’t move. If an effect tries to attach an Aura, Equipment, or Fortification to the object or player it’s already attached to, the effect does nothing. If an effect tries to attach an object that isn’t an Aura, Equipment, or Fortification to another object or player, the effect does nothing and the first object doesn’t move.</p>
<p><a id="cr701.3c"><b>701.3c</b></a> Attaching an Aura, Equipment, or Fortification on the battlefield to a different object or player causes the Aura, Equipment, or Fortification to receive a new timestamp.</p>
<p><a id="cr701.3d"><b>701.3d</b></a> To “unattach” an Equipment from a creature means to move it away from that creature so the Equipment is on the battlefield but is not equipping anything. It should no longer be physically touching any creature. If an Aura, Equipment, or Fortification that was attached to an object or player ceases to be attached to it, that counts as “becoming unattached [from that object or player]”; this includes if that Aura, Equipment, or Fortification leaves the battlefield, the object leaves the zone it was in, or that player leaves the game.</p>
<p><a id="cr701.4"><b>701.4.</b></a> Cast</p>
<p><a id="cr701.4a"><b>701.4a</b></a> To cast a spell is to take it from the zone it’s in (usually the hand), put it on the stack, and pay its costs, so that it will eventually resolve and have its effect. A player may cast a spell if they have priority. See rule <a href="#cr601">601</a>, “Casting Spells.”</p>
<p><a id="cr701.4b"><b>701.4b</b></a> To cast a card is to cast it as a spell.</p>

<p><a id="cr701.6c"><b>701.6c</b></a> Previously, an effect that created tokens instructed a player to “put [those tokens] onto the battlefield.” Cards that were printed with that text have received errata in the Oracle card reference so they now “create” those tokens.</p>

<p><a id="cr701.9a"><b>701.9a</b></a> Doubling a creature’s power and/or toughness creates a continuous effect. This effect modifies that creature’s power and/or toughness but doesn’t set those characteristics to a specific value. See rule <a href="#cr613.4c">613.4c</a>.</p>
<p><a id="cr701.9b"><b>701.9b</b></a> To double a creature’s power, that creature gets +X/+0, where X is that creature’s power as the spell or ability that doubles its power resolves. Similarly, an effect that doubles a creature’s toughness gives it +0/+X, where X is that creature’s toughness. Doubling a creature’s power and toughness gives it +X/+Y, where X is its power and Y is its toughness.</p>
<p><a id="cr701.9c"><b>701.9c</b></a> If a creature’s power is less than 0 when it’s doubled, doubling that creature’s power instead means that the creature gets -X/-0, where X is the difference between 0 and its power. Similarly, if its toughness is less than 0 when doubled, it gets -0/-X. If one characteristic’s value is negative but the other isn’t when both are doubled, it gets -X/+Y or +X/-Y, as appropriate.</p>
<p><a id="cr701.9d"><b>701.9d</b></a> To double a player’s life total, the player gains or loses an amount of life such that their new life total is twice its current value.</p>
<p><a id="cr701.9e"><b>701.9e</b></a> To double the number of a kind of counters on a player or permanent, give that player or permanent as many of those counters as that player or permanent already has.</p>
<p><a id="cr701.9f"><b>701.9f</b></a> To double the amount of a type of mana in a player’s mana pool, that player adds an amount of mana of that type equal to the amount they already have.</p>
<p><a id="cr701.10"><b>701.10.</b></a> Exchange</p>
<p><a id="cr701.10a"><b>701.10a</b></a> A spell or ability may instruct players to exchange something (for example, life totals or control of two permanents) as part of its resolution. When such a spell or ability resolves, if the entire exchange can’t be completed, no part of the exchange occurs.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> If a spell attempts to exchange control of two target creatures but one of those creatures is destroyed before the spell resolves, the spell does nothing to the other creature.</p>
<p><a id="cr701.10b"><b>701.10b</b></a> When control of two permanents is exchanged, if those permanents are controlled by different players, each of those players simultaneously gains control of the permanent that was controlled by the other player. If, on the other hand, those permanents are controlled by the same player, the exchange effect does nothing.</p>
<p><a id="cr701.10c"><b>701.10c</b></a> When life totals are exchanged, each player gains or loses the amount of life necessary to equal the other player’s previous life total. Replacement effects may modify these gains and losses, and triggered abilities may trigger on them. A player who can’t gain life can’t be given a higher life total this way, and a player who can’t lose life can’t be given a lower life total this way (see rules <a href="#cr119.7">119.7</a>–8).</p>
<p><a id="cr701.10d"><b>701.10d</b></a> Some spells or abilities may instruct a player to exchange cards in one zone with cards in a different zone (for example, exiled cards and cards in a player’s hand). These spells and abilities work the same as other “exchange” spells and abilities, except they can exchange the cards only if all the cards are owned by the same player, and they can exchange the cards even if one zone is empty.</p>
<p><a id="cr701.10e"><b>701.10e</b></a> If a card in one zone is exchanged with a card in a different zone, and either of them is attached to an object, that card stops being attached to that object and the other card becomes attached to that object.</p>
<p><a id="cr701.10f"><b>701.10f</b></a> If a spell or ability instructs a player to simply exchange two zones, and one of the zones is empty, the cards in the zones are still exchanged.</p>
<p><a id="cr701.10g"><b>701.10g</b></a> A spell or ability may instruct a player to exchange two numerical values. In such an exchange, each value becomes equal to the previous value of the other. If either of those values is a life total, the affected player gains or loses the amount of life necessary to equal the other value. Replacement effects may modify this gain or loss, and triggered abilities may trigger on it. A player who can’t gain life can’t be given a higher life total this way, and a player who can’t lose life can’t be given a lower life total this way (see rules <a href="#cr119.7">119.7</a>–8). If either of those values is a power or toughness, a continuous effect is created setting that power or toughness to the other value (see rule <a href="#cr613.4b">613.4b</a>). This rule does not apply to spells and abilities that switch a creature’s power and toughness.</p>
<p><a id="cr701.11"><b>701.11.</b></a> Exile</p>
<p><a id="cr701.11a"><b>701.11a</b></a> To exile an object, move it to the exile zone from wherever it is. See rule <a href="#cr406">406</a>, “Exile.”</p>
<p><a id="cr701.12"><b>701.12.</b></a> Fight</p>
<p><a id="cr701.12a"><b>701.12a</b></a> A spell or ability may instruct a creature to fight another creature or it may instruct two creatures to fight each other. Each of those creatures deals damage equal to its power to the other creature.</p>
<p><b>★</b> <a id="cr701.12b"><b>701.12b</b></a> A spell or ability may also instruct planeswalkers to fight. A noncreature planeswalker deals damage equal to its loyalty to the creature or planeswalker it's fighting instead of its power.</p>
<p><a id="cr701.12c"><b>701.12c</b></a> If one or both creatures instructed to fight are no longer on the battlefield or are no longer creatures, neither of them fights or deals damage. If one or both creatures are illegal targets for a resolving spell or ability that instructs them to fight, neither of them fights or deals damage.</p>
<p><a id="cr701.12d"><b>701.12d</b></a> If a creature fights itself, it deals damage to itself equal to twice its power.</p>
<p><b>★</b> <a id="cr701.12e"><b>701.12e</b></a> A creature or planeswalker wins a fight if, after the next time state-based actions are checked following a fight, that creature or planeswalker is still on the battlefield and the other creature or planeswalker it was fighting is not.</p>
<p><a id="cr701.12f"><b>701.12f</b></a> The damage dealt when a creature fights isn’t combat damage.</p>
<p><a id="cr701.13"><b>701.13.</b></a> Mill</p>
<p><a id="cr701.13a"><b>701.13a</b></a> For a player to mill a number of cards, that player puts that many cards from the top of their library into their graveyard.</p>
<p><a id="cr701.13b"><b>701.13b</b></a> A player can’t mill a number of cards greater than the number of cards in their library. If given the choice to do so, they can’t choose to take that action. If instructed to do so, they mill as many as possible. Similarly, the player can’t pay a cost that includes milling a number of cards greater than the number of cards in their library.</p>
<p><a id="cr701.13c"><b>701.13c</b></a> An effect that refers to a milled card can find that card in the zone it moved to from the library, as long as that zone is a public zone.</p>
<p><a id="cr701.13d"><b>701.13d</b></a> If an ability checks information about a single milled card but more than one card was milled, that ability refers to each of the milled cards. If that ability asks for any information about the milled card, such as a characteristic or mana value, it gets multiple answers. If these answers are used to determine the value of a variable, the sum of the answers is used. If that ability performs any actions on “the” card, it performs that action on each milled card. If that ability performs any actions on “a” card, the controller of the ability chooses which card is affected.</p>
<p><a id="cr701.14"><b>701.14.</b></a> Play</p>
<p><a id="cr701.14a"><b>701.14a</b></a> To play a land means to put it onto the battlefield from the zone it’s in (usually the hand). A player may play a land if they have priority, it’s the main phase of their turn, the stack is empty, and they haven’t played a land this turn. Playing a land is a special action (see rule <a href="#cr116">116</a>), so it doesn’t use the stack; it simply happens. Putting a land onto the battlefield as the result of a spell or ability isn’t the same as playing a land. See rule <a href="#cr305">305</a>, “Lands.”</p>
<p><a id="cr701.14b"><b>701.14b</b></a> To play a card means to play that card as a land or to cast that card as a spell, whichever is appropriate.</p>
<p><a id="cr701.14c"><b>701.14c</b></a> Some effects instruct a player to “play” with a certain aspect of the game changed, such as “Play with the top card of your library revealed.” “Play” in this sense means to play the Magic game.</p>
<p><a id="cr701.14d"><b>701.14d</b></a> Previously, the action of casting a spell, or casting a card as a spell, was referred to on cards as “playing” that spell or that card. Cards that were printed with that text have received errata in the Oracle card reference so they now refer to “casting” that spell or that card.</p>
<p><a id="cr701.14e"><b>701.14e</b></a> Previously, the action of using an activated ability was referred to on cards as “playing” that ability. Cards that were printed with that text have received errata in the Oracle card reference so they now refer to “activating” that ability.</p>
<p><a id="cr701.15"><b>701.15.</b></a> Regenerate</p>
<p><a id="cr701.15a"><b>701.15a</b></a> If the effect of a resolving spell or ability regenerates a permanent, it creates a replacement effect that protects the permanent the next time it would be destroyed this turn. In this case, “Regenerate [permanent]” means “The next time [permanent] would be destroyed this turn, instead remove all damage marked on it and tap it. If it’s an attacking or blocking creature, remove it from combat.”</p>
<p><a id="cr701.15b"><b>701.15b</b></a> If the effect of a static ability regenerates a permanent, it replaces destruction with an alternate effect each time that permanent would be destroyed. In this case, “Regenerate [permanent]” means “Instead remove all damage marked on [permanent] and tap it. If it’s an attacking or blocking creature, remove it from combat.”</p>
<p><a id="cr701.15c"><b>701.15c</b></a> Neither activating an ability that creates a regeneration shield nor casting a spell that creates a regeneration shield is the same as regenerating a permanent. Effects that say that a permanent can’t be regenerated don’t preclude such abilities from being activated or such spells from being cast; rather, they cause regeneration shields to not be applied.</p>
<p><a id="cr701.16"><b>701.16.</b></a> Reveal</p>
<p><a id="cr701.16a"><b>701.16a</b></a> To reveal a card, show that card to all players for a brief time. If an effect causes a card to be revealed, it remains revealed for as long as necessary to complete the parts of the effect that card is relevant to. If the cost to cast a spell or activate an ability includes revealing a card, the card remains revealed from the time the spell or ability is announced until the time it leaves the stack. If revealing a card causes a triggered ability to trigger, the card remains revealed until that triggered ability leaves the stack. If that ability isn’t put onto the stack the next time a player would receive priority, the card ceases to be revealed.</p>
<p><a id="cr701.16b"><b>701.16b</b></a> Revealing a card doesn’t cause it to leave the zone it’s in.</p>
<p><a id="cr701.16c"><b>701.16c</b></a> If cards in a player’s library are shuffled or otherwise reordered, any revealed cards that are reordered stop being revealed and become new objects.</p>
<p><a id="cr701.16d"><b>701.16d</b></a> Some effects instruct a player to look at one or more cards. Looking at a card follows the same rules as revealing a card, except that the card is shown only to the specified player.</p>
<p><a id="cr701.17"><b>701.17.</b></a> Sacrifice</p>
<p><a id="cr701.17a"><b>701.17a</b></a> To sacrifice a permanent, its controller moves it from the battlefield directly to its owner’s graveyard. A player can’t sacrifice something that isn’t a permanent, or something that’s a permanent they don’t control. Sacrificing a permanent doesn’t destroy it, so regeneration or other effects that replace destruction can’t affect this action.</p>
<p><a id="cr701.18"><b>701.18.</b></a> Scry</p>
<p><a id="cr701.18a"><b>701.18a</b></a> To “scry N” means to look at the top N cards of your library, then put any number of them on the bottom of your library in any order and the rest on top of your library in any order.</p>
<p><a id="cr701.18b"><b>701.18b</b></a> If a player is instructed to scry 0, no scry event occurs. Abilities that trigger whenever a player scries won’t trigger.</p>
<p><a id="cr701.18c"><b>701.18c</b></a> If multiple players scry at once, each of those players looks at the top cards of their library at the same time. Those players decide in APNAP order (see rule <a href="#cr101.4">101.4</a>) where to put those cards, then those cards move at the same time.</p>
<p><a id="cr701.19"><b>701.19.</b></a> Search</p>
<p><a id="cr701.19a"><b>701.19a</b></a> To search for a card in a zone, look at all cards in that zone (even if it’s a hidden zone) and find a card that matches the given description.</p>
<p><a id="cr701.19b"><b>701.19b</b></a> If a player is searching a hidden zone for cards with a stated quality, such as a card with a certain card type or color, that player isn’t required to find some or all of those cards even if they’re present in that zone.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Splinter says “Exile target artifact. Search its controller’s graveyard, hand, and library for all cards with the same name as that artifact and exile them. Then that player shuffles their library.” A player casts Splinter targeting Howling Mine (an artifact). Howling Mine’s controller has another Howling Mine in her graveyard and two more in her library. Splinter’s controller must find the Howling Mine in the graveyard, but may choose to find zero, one, or two of the Howling Mines in the library.</p>
<p><a id="cr701.19c"><b>701.19c</b></a> If a player is instructed to search a hidden zone for cards that match an undefined quality, that player may still search that zone but can’t find any cards.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Lobotomy says “Target player reveals their hand, then you choose a card other than a basic land card from it. Search that player’s graveyard, hand, and library for all cards with the same name as the chosen card and exile them. Then that player shuffles their library.” If the target player has no cards in their hand when Lobotomy resolves, the player who cast Lobotomy searches the specified zones but doesn’t exile any cards.</p>
<p><a id="cr701.19d"><b>701.19d</b></a> If a player is searching a hidden zone simply for a quantity of cards, such as “a card” or “three cards,” that player must find that many cards (or as many as possible, if the zone doesn’t contain enough cards).</p>
<p><a id="cr701.19e"><b>701.19e</b></a> If the effect that contains the search instruction doesn’t also contain instructions to reveal the found card(s), then they’re not revealed.</p>
<p><a id="cr701.19f"><b>701.19f</b></a> If searching a zone is replaced with searching a portion of that zone, any other instructions that refer to searching the zone still apply. Any abilities that trigger on a library being searched will trigger.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Aven Mindcensor says, in part, “If an opponent would search a library, that player searches the top four cards of that library instead.” Veteran Explorer says “When Veteran Explorer dies, each player may search their library for up to two basic land cards and put them onto the battlefield. Then each player who searched their library this way shuffles it.” An opponent who searched the top four cards of their library because of Veteran Explorer’s ability would shuffle the entire library.</p>
<p><a id="cr701.19g"><b>701.19g</b></a> If an effect offers a player a choice to search a zone and take additional actions with the cards found, that player may choose to search even if the additional actions are illegal or impossible.</p>
<p><a id="cr701.19h"><b>701.19h</b></a> An effect may instruct a player to search a library for one or more cards more than once before instructing a player to shuffle that library. This is the same as a single instruction for that player to search that library for all those cards. The player searches that library only once.</p>
<p><a id="cr701.19i"><b>701.19i</b></a> If multiple players search at once, each of those players looks at the appropriate cards at the same time, then those players decide in APNAP order (see rule <a href="#cr101.4">101.4</a>) which card to find.</p>
<p><a id="cr701.20"><b>701.20.</b></a> Shuffle</p>
<p><a id="cr701.20a"><b>701.20a</b></a> To shuffle a library or a face-down pile of cards, randomize the cards within it so that no player knows their order.</p>
<p><a id="cr701.20b"><b>701.20b</b></a> Some effects cause a player to search a library for a card or cards, shuffle that library, then put some or all of the found cards into a different zone or in a certain position in that library. In such cases, the found cards aren’t included in the shuffle, even though they remain in the library at that time. Rather, all the cards in that library except those are shuffled. Abilities that trigger when a library is shuffled will still trigger. See also rule <a href="#cr401">401</a>, “Library.”</p>
<p><a id="cr701.20c"><b>701.20c</b></a> If an effect would cause a player to shuffle one or more specific objects into a library, that library is shuffled even if none of those objects are in the zone they’re expected to be in or an effect causes all of those objects to be moved to another zone or remain in their current zone.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Guile says, in part, “When Guile is put into a graveyard from anywhere, shuffle it into its owner’s library.” It’s put into a graveyard and its ability triggers, then a player exiles it from that graveyard in response. When the ability resolves, the library is shuffled.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Black Sun’s Zenith says, in part, “Shuffle Black Sun’s Zenith into its owner’s library.” Black Sun’s Zenith is in a graveyard, has gained flashback (due to Recoup, perhaps), and is cast from that graveyard. Black Sun’s Zenith will be exiled, and its owner’s library will be shuffled.</p>
<p><a id="cr701.20d"><b>701.20d</b></a> If an effect would cause a player to shuffle a set of objects into a library, that library is shuffled even if there are no objects in that set.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Loaming Shaman says “When Loaming Shaman enters the battlefield, target player shuffles any number of target cards from their graveyard into their library.” It enters the battlefield, its ability triggers, and no cards are targeted. When the ability resolves, the targeted player will still have to shuffle their library.</p>
<p><a id="cr701.20e"><b>701.20e</b></a> If an effect causes a player to shuffle a library containing zero or one cards, abilities that trigger when a library is shuffled will still trigger.</p>
<p><a id="cr701.20f"><b>701.20f</b></a> If two or more effects cause a library to be shuffled multiple times simultaneously, abilities that trigger when that library is shuffled will trigger that many times.</p>
<p><a id="cr701.20g"><b>701.20g</b></a> If an effect would cause a player to shuffle a library at the same time that an object would be put into a certain position in that library, the result is a shuffled library that’s randomized except that the object is in the specified position.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Darksteel Colossus and Gravebane Zombie are put into a player’s graveyard from the battlefield at the same time. Darksteel Colossus says in part “If Darksteel Colossus would be put into a graveyard from anywhere, reveal Darksteel Colossus and shuffle it into its owner’s library instead.” Gravebane Zombie says “If Gravebane Zombie would die, put Gravebane Zombie on top of its owner’s library instead.” The player shuffles Darksteel Colossus into their library and puts Gravebane Zombie on top of that library.</p>
<p><a id="cr701.21"><b>701.21.</b></a> Tap and Untap</p>
<p><a id="cr701.21a"><b>701.21a</b></a> To tap a permanent, turn it sideways from an upright position. Only untapped permanents can be tapped.</p>
<p><a id="cr701.21b"><b>701.21b</b></a> To untap a permanent, rotate it back to the upright position from a sideways position. Only tapped permanents can be untapped.</p>

<p><a id="cr701.22a"><b>701.22a</b></a> To “fateseal N” means to look at the top N cards of an opponent’s library, then put any number of them on the bottom of that library in any order and the rest on top of that library in any order.</p>
<p><a id="cr701.23"><b>701.23.</b></a> Clash</p>
<p><a id="cr701.23a"><b>701.23a</b></a> To clash, a player reveals the top card of their library. That player may then put that card on the bottom of their library.</p>

<p><a id="cr702"><b>702. Keyword Abilities</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr702.1"><b>702.1.</b></a> Most abilities describe exactly what they do in the card’s rules text. Some, though, are very common or would require too much space to define on the card. In these cases, the object lists only the name of the ability as a “keyword”; sometimes reminder text summarizes the game rule.</p>
<p><a id="cr702.1a"><b>702.1a</b></a> If an effect refers to a “[keyword ability] cost,” it refers only to the variable costs for that keyword.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Varolz, the Scar-Striped has an ability that says “Each creature card in your graveyard has scavenge. The scavenge cost is equal to its mana cost.” A creature card’s scavenge cost is an amount of mana equal to its mana cost, and the activation cost of the scavenge ability is that amount of mana plus “Exile this card from your graveyard.”</p>
<p><a id="cr702.1b"><b>702.1b</b></a> An effect that grants an object a keyword ability may define a variable in that ability based on characteristics of that object or other information about the game state. For these abilities, the value of that variable is constantly reevaluated.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Volcano Hellion has the ability “Volcano Hellion has echo {X}, where X is your life total.” If your life total is 10 when Volcano Hellion’s echo ability triggers but 5 when it resolves, the echo cost to pay is {5}.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Fire//Ice is a split card whose halves have the mana costs {1}{R} and {1}{U}. Past in Flames reads “Each instant and sorcery card in your graveyard gains flashback until end of turn. The flashback cost is equal to its mana cost.” Fire//Ice has “Flashback {2}{U}{R}” while it is in your graveyard, but if you choose to cast Fire, the resulting spell has “Flashback {1}{R}.”</p>
<p><a id="cr702.1c"><b>702.1c</b></a> An effect may state that “the same is true for” a list of keyword abilities or similar. If one of those keyword abilities has variants or variables and the effect grants that keyword or counters of that keyword to one or more objects and/or players, it grants each appropriate variant and variable of that keyword.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Concerted Effort is an enchantment that reads “At the beginning of each upkeep, creatures you control gain flying until end of turn if a creature you control has flying. The same is true for fear, first strike, double strike, landwalk, protection, trample, and vigilance.” As that triggered ability resolves, each landwalk and protection ability from among creatures you control is granted to each creature you control.</p>
<p><a id="cr702.1d"><b>702.1d</b></a> An effect may refer to an object “with [keyword ability]” or “that has [keyword ability].” This means the same thing as an object “with a [keyword ability] ability” or an object “that has a [keyword ability] ability.”</p>

Any effect that increases or reduces a cycling cost will increase or reduce a typecycling cost. Any effect that looks for a card with cycling will find a card with typecycling.</p>

<p><a id="cr702.37a"><b>702.37a</b></a> Morph is a static ability that functions in any zone from which you could play the card it’s on, and the morph effect works any time the card is face down. “Morph [cost]” means “You may cast this card as a 2/2 face-down creature with no text, no name, no subtypes, and no mana cost by paying {3} rather than paying its mana cost.” (See rule <a href="#cr708">708</a>, “Face-Down Spells and Permanents.”)</p>
<p><a id="cr702.37b"><b>702.37b</b></a> Megamorph is a variant of the morph ability. “Megamorph [cost]” means “You may cast this card as a 2/2 face-down creature with no text, no name, no subtypes, and no mana cost by paying {3} rather than paying its mana cost” and “As this permanent is turned face up, put a +1/+1 counter on it if its megamorph cost was paid to turn it face up.” A megamorph cost is a morph cost.</p>
<p><b>★</b> <a id="cr702.37c"><b>702.37c</b></a> Metamorph is a variant of the morph ability. “Metamorph (cost)” means “You may cast this card as a 2/2 face-down creature with no text, no name, no subtypes, and no mana cost by paying (3) rather than paying its mana cost.” and “As this permanent is turned face up, cast it without paying its mana cost if its metamorph cost was paid to turn it face up.” A metamorph cost is a morph cost. There is never a time where a face up card with metamorph is on the battlefield.</p>
<p><a id="cr702.37d"><b>702.37d</b></a> To cast a card using its morph ability, turn it face down. It becomes a 2/2 face-down creature card with no text, no name, no subtypes, and no mana cost. Any effects or prohibitions that would apply to casting a card with these characteristics (and not the face-up card’s characteristics) are applied to casting this card. These values are the copiable values of that object’s characteristics. (See rule <a href="#cr613">613</a>, “Interaction of Continuous Effects,” and rule <a href="#cr707">707</a>, “Copying Objects.”) Put it onto the stack (as a face-down spell with the same characteristics), and pay {3} rather than pay its mana cost. This follows the rules for paying alternative costs. You can use a morph ability to cast a card from any zone from which you could normally play it. When the spell resolves, it enters the battlefield with the same characteristics the spell had. The morph effect applies to the face-down object wherever it is, and it ends when the permanent is turned face up.</p>
<p><a id="cr702.37e"><b>702.37e</b></a> You can’t normally cast a card face down. A morph ability allows you to do so.</p>
<p><a id="cr702.37f"><b>702.37f</b></a> Any time you have priority, you may turn a face-down permanent you control with a morph ability face up.

To do this, show all players what the permanent’s morph cost would be if it were face up, pay that cost, then turn the permanent face up. (If the permanent wouldn’t have a morph cost if it were face up, it can’t be turned face up this way.) The morph effect on it ends, and it regains its normal characteristics. Any abilities relating to the permanent entering the battlefield don’t trigger when it’s turned face up and don’t have any effect, because the permanent has already entered the battlefield.</p>
<p><a id="cr702.37g"><b>702.37g</b></a> If a permanent’s morph cost includes X, other abilities of that permanent may also refer to X. The value of X in those abilities is equal to the value of X chosen as the morph special action was taken.</p>

If you do, you pay an additional [cost].” Using the entwine ability follows the rules for choosing modes and paying additional costs in rules <a href="#cr601.2b">601.2b</a> and <a href="#cr601.2f">601.2f</a>–h.</p>

<p><a id="cr702.44a"><b>702.44a</b></a> Sunburst is a static ability that functions as an object is entering the battlefield. “Sunburst” means “If this object is entering the battlefield as a creature, ignoring any type-changing effects that would affect it, it enters the battlefield with a +1/+1 counter on it for each color of mana spent to cast it. Otherwise, it enters the battlefield with a charge counter on it for each color of mana spent to cast it.”</p>
<p><a id="cr702.44b"><b>702.44b</b></a> Sunburst adds counters only if the object with sunburst is entering the battlefield from the stack as a resolving spell and only if one or more colored mana was spent on its costs, including additional or alternative costs.</p>
<p><a id="cr702.44c"><b>702.44c</b></a> Sunburst can also be used to set a variable number for another ability. If the keyword is used in this way, it doesn’t matter whether the ability is on a creature spell or on a noncreature spell.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> The ability “Modular—Sunburst” means “This permanent enters the battlefield with a +1/+1 counter on it for each color of mana spent to cast it” and “When this permanent is put into a graveyard from the battlefield, you may put a +1/+1 counter on target artifact creature for each +1/+1 counter on this permanent.”</p>

<p><a id="cr702.47"><b>702.47.</b></a> Splice</p>
<p><a id="cr702.47a"><b>702.47a</b></a> Splice is a static ability that functions while a card is in your hand. “Splice onto [quality] [cost]” means “You may reveal this card from your hand as you cast a [quality] spell. If you do, that spell gains the text of this card’s rules text and you pay [cost] as an additional cost to cast that spell.” Paying a card’s splice cost follows the rules for paying additional costs in rules <a href="#cr601.2b">601.2b</a> and <a href="#cr601.2f">601.2f</a>–h.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Since the card with splice remains in the player’s hand, it can later be cast normally or spliced onto another spell.

<p><a id="cr702.47b"><b>702.47b</b></a> You can’t choose to use a splice ability if you can’t make the required choices (targets, etc.) for that card’s rules text. You can’t splice any one card onto the same spell more than once. If you’re splicing more than one card onto a spell, reveal them all at once and choose the order in which their effects will happen. The effects of the main spell must happen first.</p>
<p><a id="cr702.47c"><b>702.47c</b></a> The spell has the characteristics of the main spell, plus the rules text of each of the spliced cards. This is a text-changing effect (see rule <a href="#cr612">612</a>, “Text-Changing Effects”). The spell doesn’t gain any other characteristics (name, mana cost, color, supertypes, card types, subtypes, etc.) of the spliced cards. Text gained by the spell that refers to a card by name refers to the spell on the stack, not the card from which the text was copied.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Glacial Ray is a red card with splice onto Arcane that reads, “Glacial Ray deals 2 damage to any target.” Suppose Glacial Ray is spliced onto Reach Through Mists, a blue spell.

<p><a id="cr704.3"><b>704.3.</b></a> Whenever a player would get priority (see rule <a href="#cr117">117</a>, “Timing and Priority”), the game checks for any of the listed conditions for state-based actions, then performs all applicable state-based actions simultaneously as a single event. If any state-based actions are performed as a result of a check, the check is repeated; otherwise all triggered abilities that are waiting to be put on the stack are put on the stack, then the check is repeated. Once no more state-based actions have been performed as the result of a check and no triggered abilities are waiting to be put on the stack, the appropriate player gets priority. This process also occurs during the cleanup step (see rule <a href="#cr514">514</a>), except that if no state-based actions are performed as the result of the step’s first check and no triggered abilities are waiting to be put on the stack, then no player gets priority and the step ends.</p>
<p><a id="cr704.4"><b>704.4.</b></a> Unlike triggered abilities, state-based actions pay no attention to what happens during the resolution of a spell or ability.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> A player controls a creature with the ability “This creature’s power and toughness are each equal to the number of cards in your hand” and casts a spell whose effect is “Discard your hand, then draw seven cards.” The creature will temporarily have toughness 0 in the middle of the spell’s resolution but will be back up to toughness 7 when the spell finishes resolving. Thus the creature will survive when state-based actions are checked. In contrast, an ability that triggers when the player has no cards in hand goes on the stack after the spell resolves, because its trigger event happened during resolution.</p>

<p><a id="cr705.1"><b>705.1.</b></a> An effect that instructs a player to flip a coin may care whether that player wins or loses the flip. To flip a coin for such an effect, the player flips the coin and calls “heads” or “tails.” If the call matches the result, the player wins the flip. Otherwise, the player loses the flip. Only the player who flips the coin wins or loses the flip; no other players are involved.</p>
<p><a id="cr705.2"><b>705.2.</b></a> If an effect instructs a player to flip a coin and that effect cares only whether the coin comes up heads or tails without specifying a winner or loser of the flip, that player flips a coin without making a call. No player wins or loses this kind of flip.</p>
<p><a id="cr705.3"><b>705.3.</b></a> A coin used in a flip must be a two-sided object with easily distinguished sides and equal likelihood that either side lands face up. If the coin that’s being flipped doesn’t have an obvious “heads” or “tails,” designate one side to be “heads,” and the other side to be “tails.” Other methods of randomization may be substituted for flipping a coin as long as there are two possible outcomes of equal likelihood and all players agree to the substitution. For example, the player may roll an even-sided die and call “odds” or “evens,” or roll an even-sided die and designate that “odds” means “heads” and “evens” means “tails.”</p>
<p><a id="cr706"><b>706. Rolling a Die</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr706.1"><b>706.1.</b></a> An effect that instructs a player to roll a die will specify what kind of die to roll and how many of those dice to roll.</p>
<p><a id="cr706.1a"><b>706.1a</b></a> Such an effect may refer to an “N-sided die,” “N-sided dice,” or one or more “dN,” where N is a positive integer. In all cases, the die must have N equally-likely outcomes, numbered from 1 to N. For example, a d20 is a twenty-sided die with possible outcomes from 1 to 20.</p>
<p><a id="cr706.1b"><b>706.1b</b></a> Players may agree to use an alternate method for rolling a die, including a digital substitute, as long as the method used has the same number of equally-likely outcomes as the die specified in the instruction.</p>
<p><a id="cr706.2"><b>706.2.</b></a> After the roll, the number indicated on the top face of the die before any modifiers is the natural result. The instruction may include modifiers to the roll which add to or subtract from the natural result. Modifiers may also come from other sources.

<p><a id="cr706.3"><b>706.3.</b></a> Some abilities that instruct a player to roll one or more dice include a results table.</p>
<p><a id="cr706.3a"><b>706.3a</b></a> The results table appears as a chart with multiple striations. Each striation includes possible results and an effect associated with those results. The possible results indicated could be a single number, a range of numbers with two endpoints in the form “N1–N2,” or a range with a single endpoint in the form “N+.” Each striation of the results chart means “If the result was in this range, [effect].” After a die roll, use the result to determine which effect listed on the results table happens.</p>
<p><a id="cr706.3b"><b>706.3b</b></a> An instruction to roll one or more dice, any instructions to modify that roll printed in the same paragraph, any additional instructions based on the result of the roll, and the associated results table are all part of one ability.</p>

<p><a id="cr706.4"><b>706.4.</b></a> Some abilities that instruct a player to roll one or more dice do not include a results table. The text of those abilities will indicate how to use the results of the die rolls.</p>
<p><a id="cr706.5"><b>706.5.</b></a> If a player is instructed to roll two or more dice and ignore the lowest roll, the roll that yielded the lowest result is considered to have never happened. No abilities trigger because of the ignored roll, and no effects apply to that roll. If multiple results are tied for the lowest, the player chooses one of those rolls to be ignored.</p>
<p><a id="cr706.6"><b>706.6.</b></a> In a Planechase game, rolling the planar die will cause any ability that triggers whenever a player rolls one or more dice to trigger. However, any effect that refers to a numerical result of a die roll, including ones that compare the results of that roll to other rolls or to a given number, ignores the rolling of the planar die. See rule <a href="#cr901">901</a>, “Planechase.”</p>
<p><a id="cr707"><b>707. Copying Objects</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr707.1"><b>707.1.</b></a> Some objects become or turn another object into a “copy” of a spell, permanent, or card. Some effects create a token that’s a copy of another object. (Certain older cards were printed with the phrase “search for a copy.” This section doesn’t cover those cards, which have received new text in the Oracle card reference.)</p>
<p><a id="cr707.2"><b>707.2.</b></a> When copying an object, the copy acquires the copiable values of the original object’s characteristics and, for an object on the stack, choices made when casting or activating it (mode, targets, the value of X, whether it was kicked, how it will affect multiple targets, and so on). The copiable values are the values derived from the text printed on the object (that text being name, mana cost, color indicator, card type, subtype, supertype, rules text, power, toughness, and/or loyalty), as modified by other copy effects, by its face-down status, and by “as . . . enters the battlefield” and “as . . . is turned face up” abilities that set power and toughness (and may also set additional characteristics). Other effects (including type-changing and text-changing effects), status, and counters are not copied.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Chimeric Staff is an artifact that reads, “{X}: Chimeric Staff becomes an X/X artifact creature until end of turn.” Clone is a creature that reads, “You may have Clone enter the battlefield as a copy of any creature on the battlefield.” After a Staff has become a 5/5 artifact creature, a Clone enters the battlefield as a copy of it. The Clone is an artifact, not a 5/5 artifact creature. (The copy has the Staff’s ability, however, and will become a creature if that ability is activated.)<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Clone enters the battlefield as a copy of a face-down Grinning Demon (a creature with morph {2}{B}{B}). The Clone is a colorless 2/2 creature with no name, no types, no abilities, and no mana cost. It will still be face up. Its controller can’t pay {2}{B}{B} to turn it face up.</p>
<p><a id="cr707.2a"><b>707.2a</b></a> A copy acquires the color of the object it’s copying because that value is derived from its mana cost or color indicator. A copy acquires the abilities of the object it’s copying because those values are derived from its rules text. A copy doesn’t wind up with two values of each ability (that is, it doesn’t copy the object’s abilities and its rules text, then have that rules text define a new set of abilities).</p>
<p><a id="cr707.2b"><b>707.2b</b></a> Once an object has been copied, changing the copiable values of the original object won’t cause the copy to change.</p>
<p><a id="cr707.2c"><b>707.2c</b></a> If a static ability generates a continuous effect that’s a copy effect, the copiable values that effect grants are determined only at the time that effect first starts to apply.</p>
<p><a id="cr707.3"><b>707.3.</b></a> The copy’s copiable values become the copied information, as modified by the copy’s status (see rule <a href="#cr110.5">110.5</a>). Objects that copy the object will use the new copiable values.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Vesuvan Doppelganger reads, “You may have Vesuvan Doppelganger enter the battlefield as a copy of any creature on the battlefield, except it doesn’t copy that creature’s color and it has ‘At the beginning of your upkeep, you may have this creature become a copy of target creature, except it doesn’t copy that creature’s color and it has this ability.’” A Vesuvan Doppelganger enters the battlefield as a copy of Runeclaw Bear (a 2/2 green Bear creature with no abilities). Then a Clone enters the battlefield as a copy of the Doppelganger. The Clone is a 2/2 blue Bear named Runeclaw Bear that has the Doppelganger’s upkeep-triggered ability.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Tomoya the Revealer (a flipped flip card) becomes a copy of Nezumi Shortfang (an unflipped flip card). Tomoya’s characteristics become the characteristics of Stabwhisker the Odious, which is the flipped version of Nezumi Shortfang.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> A face-down Grinning Demon (a creature with morph) becomes a copy of a face-up Branchsnap Lorian (a 4/1 green creature with trample and morph {G}). The Demon’s characteristics become the characteristics of Branchsnap Lorian. However, since the creature is face down, it remains a 2/2 colorless creature with no name, types, or abilities, and no mana cost. It can be turned face up for {G}. If it’s turned face up, it will have the characteristics of Branchsnap Lorian.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> A face-down Grinning Demon (a creature with morph) becomes a copy of Wandering Ones (a 1/1 blue Spirit creature that doesn’t have morph). It will be a face-down Wandering Ones. It remains a 2/2 colorless creature with no name, types, or abilities, and no mana cost. Its controller can’t turn it face up as a special action. If an effect turns it face up, it will have the characteristics of Wandering Ones.</p>
<p><a id="cr707.4"><b>707.4.</b></a> Some effects cause a permanent that’s copying a permanent to copy a different object while remaining on the battlefield. The change doesn’t trigger enters-the-battlefield or leaves-the-battlefield abilities. This also doesn’t change any noncopy effects presently affecting the permanent.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Unstable Shapeshifter reads, “Whenever a creature enters the battlefield, Unstable Shapeshifter becomes a copy of that creature and gains this ability.” It’s affected by Giant Growth, which reads “Target creature gets +3/+3 until end of turn.” If a creature enters the battlefield later this turn, Unstable Shapeshifter will become a copy of that creature, but it will still get +3/+3 from the Giant Growth.</p>
<p><a id="cr707.5"><b>707.5.</b></a> An object that enters the battlefield “as a copy” or “that’s a copy” of another object becomes a copy as it enters the battlefield. It doesn’t enter the battlefield, and then become a copy of that permanent. If the text that’s being copied includes any abilities that replace the enters-the-battlefield event (such as “enters the battlefield with” or “as [this] enters the battlefield” abilities), those abilities will take effect. Also, any enters-the-battlefield triggered abilities of the copy will have a chance to trigger.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Skyshroud Behemoth reads, “Fading 2 (This creature enters the battlefield with two fade counters on it. At the beginning of your upkeep, remove a fade counter from it. If you can’t, sacrifice it.)” and “Skyshroud Behemoth enters the battlefield tapped.” A Clone that enters the battlefield as a copy of a Skyshroud Behemoth will also enter the battlefield tapped with two fade counters on it.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Wall of Omens reads, “When Wall of Omens enters the battlefield, draw a card.” A Clone enters the battlefield as a copy of Wall of Omens. The Clone has the Wall’s enters-the-battlefield triggered ability, so the Clone’s controller draws a card.</p>
<p><a id="cr707.6"><b>707.6.</b></a> When copying a permanent, any choices that have been made for that permanent aren’t copied. Instead, if an object enters the battlefield as a copy of another permanent, the object’s controller will get to make any “as [this] enters the battlefield” choices for it.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> A Clone enters the battlefield as a copy of Adaptive Automaton. Adaptive Automaton reads, in part, “As Adaptive Automaton enters the battlefield, choose a creature type.” The Clone won’t copy the creature type choice of the Automaton; rather, the controller of the Clone will get to make a new choice.</p>
<p><a id="cr707.7"><b>707.7.</b></a> If a pair of linked abilities are copied, those abilities will be similarly linked to one another on the object that copied them. One ability refers only to actions that were taken or objects that were affected by the other. They can’t be linked to any other ability, regardless of what other abilities the copy may currently have or may have had in the past. See rule <a href="#cr607">607</a>, “Linked Abilities.”</p>
<p><a id="cr707.8"><b>707.8.</b></a> When copying a double-faced card, a face-up meld card, or a melded permanent, only the copiable values of the face that’s currently up are copied. (See rule <a href="#cr712">712</a>, “Double-Faced Cards,” and rule <a href="#cr713">713</a>, “Meld Cards.”)</p>
<p><a id="cr707.9"><b>707.9.</b></a> Copy effects may include modifications or exceptions to the copying process.</p>
<p><a id="cr707.9a"><b>707.9a</b></a> Some copy effects cause the copy to gain an ability as part of the copying process. This ability becomes part of the copiable values for the copy, along with any other abilities that were copied.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Quirion Elves enters the battlefield and an Unstable Shapeshifter copies it. The copiable values of the Shapeshifter now match those of the Elves, except that the Shapeshifter also has the ability “Whenever a creature enters the battlefield, Unstable Shapeshifter becomes a copy of that creature, except it has this ability.” Then a Clone enters the battlefield as a copy of the Unstable Shapeshifter. The Clone copies the new copiable values of the Shapeshifter, including the ability that the Shapeshifter gave itself when it copied the Elves.</p>
<p><a id="cr707.9b"><b>707.9b</b></a> Some copy effects modify a characteristic as part of the copying process. The final set of values for that characteristic becomes part of the copiable values of the copy.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Copy Artifact is an enchantment that reads, “You may have Copy Artifact enter the battlefield as a copy of any artifact on the battlefield, except it’s an enchantment in addition to its other types.” It enters the battlefield as a copy of Juggernaut. The copiable values of the Copy Artifact now match those of Juggernaut with one modification: its types are now artifact, creature, and enchantment.</p>
<p><a id="cr707.9c"><b>707.9c</b></a> Some copy effects specifically state that they don’t copy certain characteristics and the affected objects instead retain their original values. Copy effects may also simply state that certain characteristics are not copied.</p>
<p><a id="cr707.9d"><b>707.9d</b></a> When applying a copy effect that doesn’t copy a certain characteristic, retains one or more original values for a certain characteristic, or provides a specific set of values for a certain characteristic, any characteristic-defining ability (see rule <a href="#cr604.3">604.3</a>) of the object being copied that defines that characteristic is not copied. If that characteristic is color, any color indicator (see rule <a href="#cr204">204</a>) of that object is also not copied. This rule does not apply to copy effects with exceptions that state the object is a certain card type, supertype, and/or subtype “in addition to its other types.” In those cases, any characteristic-defining ability that defines card type, supertype, and/or subtype is copied.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Quicksilver Gargantuan is a creature that reads, “You may have Quicksilver Gargantuan enter the battlefield as a copy of any creature on the battlefield, except it’s 7/7.” Quicksilver Gargantuan enters the battlefield as a copy of Tarmogoyf, which has a characteristic-defining ability that defines its power and toughness. Quicksilver Gargantuan does not have that ability. It will be 7/7.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Glasspool Mimic is a creature that reads “You may have Glasspool Mimic enter the battlefield as a copy of a creature you control, except it’s a Shapeshifter Rogue in addition to its other types.” Glasspool Mimic enters the battlefield as a copy of a creature with changeling. Glasspool Mimic will have changeling and will have all creature types.</p>
<p><a id="cr707.9e"><b>707.9e</b></a> Some replacement effects that generate copy effects include an exception that’s an additional effect rather than a modification of the affected object’s characteristics. If another copy effect is applied to that object after applying the copy effect with that exception, the exception’s effect doesn’t happen.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Altered Ego reads, “You may have Altered Ego enter the battlefield as a copy of any creature on the battlefield, except it enters with X additional +1/+1 counters on it.” You choose for it to enter the battlefield as a copy of Clone, which reads “You may have Clone enter the battlefield as a copy of any creature on the battlefield,” for which no creature was chosen as it entered the battlefield. If you then choose a creature to copy as you apply the replacement effect Altered Ego gains by copying Clone, Altered Ego’s replacement effect won’t cause it to enter the battlefield with any +1/+1 counters on it.</p>
<p><a id="cr707.9f"><b>707.9f</b></a> Some exceptions to the copying process apply only if the copy is or has certain characteristics. To determine whether such an exception applies, consider what the resulting permanent’s characteristics would be if the copy effect were applied without that exception, taking into account any other exceptions that effect includes.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Moritte of the Frost says, in part, “You may have Moritte of the Frost enter the battlefield as a copy of a permanent you control, except it’s legendary and snow in addition to its other types and, if it’s a creature, it enters with two additional +1/+1 counters on it and it has changeling.” Moritte of the Frost copies a land that has become a creature until end of turn. It would enter as a noncreature permanent, so it won’t enter with two additional +1+1 counters on it and it won’t have changeling, even if it becomes a creature later in the turn.</p>
<p><a id="cr707.9g"><b>707.9g</b></a> Some replacement effects that generate copy effects are linked to triggered abilities written in the same paragraph. (See rule <a href="#cr603.11">603.11</a>.) If another copy effect is applied to that object after applying the copy effect with the linked triggered ability, the ability doesn’t trigger.</p>
<p><a id="cr707.10"><b>707.10.</b></a> To copy a spell, activated ability, or triggered ability means to put a copy of it onto the stack; a copy of a spell isn’t cast and a copy of an activated ability isn’t activated. A copy of a spell or ability copies both the characteristics of the spell or ability and all decisions made for it, including modes, targets, the value of X, and additional or alternative costs. (See rule <a href="#cr601">601</a>, “Casting Spells.”) Choices that are normally made on resolution are not copied. If an effect of the copy refers to objects used to pay its costs, it uses the objects used to pay the costs of the original spell or ability. A copy of a spell is owned by the player under whose control it was put on the stack. A copy of a spell or ability is controlled by the player under whose control it was put on the stack. A copy of a spell is itself a spell, even though it has no spell card associated with it. A copy of an ability is itself an ability.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> A player casts Fork, targeting an Emerald Charm. Fork reads, “Copy target instant or sorcery spell, except that the copy is red. You may choose new targets for the copy.” Emerald Charm is a modal green instant. When the Fork resolves, it puts a copy of the Emerald Charm on the stack except the copy is red, not green. The copy has the same mode that was chosen for the original Emerald Charm. It does not necessarily have the same target, but only because Fork allows choosing of new targets.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Fling is an instant that reads, “As an additional cost to cast this spell, sacrifice a creature” and “Fling deals damage equal to the sacrificed creature’s power to any target.” When determining how much damage a copy of Fling deals, it checks the power of the creature sacrificed to pay for the original Fling.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Dawnglow Infusion is a sorcery that reads, “You gain X life if {G} was spent to cast this spell and X life if {W} was spent to cast it.” Because mana isn’t an object, a copy of Dawnglow Infusion won’t cause you to gain any life, no matter what mana was spent to cast the original spell.</p>
<p><a id="cr707.10a"><b>707.10a</b></a> If a copy of a spell is in a zone other than the stack, it ceases to exist. If a copy of a card is in any zone other than the stack or the battlefield, it ceases to exist. These are state-based actions. See rule <a href="#cr704.">704.</a></p>
<p><a id="cr707.10b"><b>707.10b</b></a> A copy of an ability has the same source as the original ability. If the ability refers to its source by name, the copy refers to that same object and not to any other object with the same name. The copy is considered to be the same ability by effects that count how many times that ability has resolved during the turn.</p>
<p><a id="cr707.10c"><b>707.10c</b></a> Some effects copy a spell or ability and state that its controller may choose new targets for the copy. The player may leave any number of the targets unchanged, even if those targets would be illegal. If the player chooses to change some or all of the targets, the new targets must be legal. Once the player has decided what the copy’s targets will be, the copy is put onto the stack with those targets.</p>
<p><a id="cr707.10d"><b>707.10d</b></a> Some effects copy a spell or ability for each player or object it “could target.” The copies are put onto the stack with those targets in the order of their controller’s choice. If the spell or ability has more than one target, each of its targets must be the same player or object. If that player or object isn’t a legal target for each instance of the word “target,” a copy isn’t created for that player or object.</p>
<p><a id="cr707.10e"><b>707.10e</b></a> Some effects copy a spell or ability and specify a new target for the copy. If the spell or ability has more than one target, each of the copy’s targets must be that player or object. If that player or object isn’t a legal target for each instance of the word “target,” the copy isn’t created.</p>
<p><a id="cr707.10f"><b>707.10f</b></a> Some effects copy a permanent spell. As that copy resolves, it ceases being a copy of a spell and becomes a token permanent. (See rule <a href="#cr608.3b">608.3b</a>.)</p>
<p><a id="cr707.11"><b>707.11.</b></a> If an effect refers to a permanent by name, the effect still tracks that permanent even if it changes names or becomes a copy of something else.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> An Unstable Shapeshifter copies a Crazed Armodon. Crazed Armodon reads, “{G}: Crazed Armodon gets +3/+0 and gains trample until end of turn. Destroy Crazed Armodon at the beginning of the next end step. Activate only once each turn.” If this ability of the Shapeshifter is activated, the Shapeshifter will be destroyed at the beginning of the next end step, even if it’s no longer a copy of Crazed Armodon at that time.</p>
<p><a id="cr707.12"><b>707.12.</b></a> An effect that instructs a player to cast a copy of an object (and not just copy a spell) follows the rules for casting spells, except that the copy is created in the same zone the object is in and then cast while another spell or ability is resolving. Casting a copy of an object follows steps 601.2a–h of rule <a href="#cr601">601</a>, “Casting Spells,” and then the copy becomes cast. Once cast, the copy is a spell on the stack, and just like any other spell it can resolve or be countered.</p>
<p><a id="cr707.13"><b>707.13.</b></a> One card (Garth One-Eye) instructs a player to create a copy of a card defined by name rather than by indicating an object to be copied. To do so, the player uses the Oracle card reference to determine the characteristics of the copy and creates the copy outside of the game.</p>
<p><a id="cr708"><b>708. Face-Down Spells and Permanents</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr708.1"><b>708.1.</b></a> Some cards allow spells and permanents to be face down.</p>
<p><a id="cr708.2"><b>708.2.</b></a> Face-down spells and face-down permanents have no characteristics other than those listed by the ability or rules that allowed the spell or permanent to be face down.

<p><a id="cr708.2a"><b>708.2a</b></a> If a face-up permanent is turned face down by a spell or ability that doesn’t list any characteristics for that object, it becomes a 2/2 face-down creature with no text, no name, no subtypes, and no mana cost. A permanent that enters the battlefield face down also has these characteristics unless otherwise specified by the effect that put it onto the battlefield face down or allowed it to be cast face down.

<p><a id="cr708.4"><b>708.4.</b></a> Objects that are cast face down are turned face down before they are put onto the stack, so effects that care about the characteristics of a spell will see only the face-down spell’s characteristics. Any effects or prohibitions that would apply to casting an object with these characteristics (and not the face-up object’s characteristics) are applied to casting this object. The permanent the spell becomes will be a face-down permanent.</p>
<p><a id="cr708.5"><b>708.5.</b></a> At any time, you may look at a face-down spell you control on the stack or a face-down permanent you control (even if it’s phased out). You can’t look at face-down cards in any other zone or face-down spells or permanents controlled by another player.</p>
<p><a id="cr708.6"><b>708.6.</b></a> If you control multiple face-down spells or face-down permanents, you must ensure at all times that your face-down spells and permanents can be easily differentiated from each other. This includes, but is not limited to, knowing what ability or rules caused the permanents to be face down, the order spells were cast, the order that face-down permanents entered the battlefield, which creature(s) attacked last turn, and any other differences between face-down spells or permanents. Common methods for distinguishing between face-down objects include using counters or dice to mark the different objects, or clearly placing those objects in order on the table.</p>
<p><a id="cr708.7"><b>708.7.</b></a> The ability or rules that allow a permanent to be face down may also allow the permanent’s controller to turn it face up. Spells normally can’t be turned face up.</p>
<p><a id="cr708.8"><b>708.8.</b></a> As a face-down permanent is turned face up, its copiable values revert to its normal copiable values. Any effects that have been applied to the face-down permanent still apply to the face-up permanent. Any abilities relating to the permanent entering the battlefield don’t trigger and don’t have any effect, because the permanent has already entered the battlefield.</p>
<p><a id="cr708.9"><b>708.9.</b></a> If a face-down permanent or a face-down component of a merged permanent moves from the battlefield to any other zone, its owner must reveal it to all players as they move it. If a face-down spell moves from the stack to any zone other than the battlefield, its owner must reveal it to all players as they move it. If a player leaves the game, all face-down permanents, face-down components of merged permanents, and face-down spells owned by that player must be revealed to all players. At the end of each game, all face-down permanents, face-down components of merged permanents, and face-down spells must be revealed to all players.</p>
<p><a id="cr708.10"><b>708.10.</b></a> If a face-down permanent becomes a copy of another permanent, its copiable values become the copiable values of that permanent, as modified by its face-down status.

<p><a id="cr709"><b>709. Split Cards</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr709.1"><b>709.1.</b></a> Split cards have two card faces on a single card. The back of a split card is the normal Magic card back.</p>
<p><a id="cr709.2"><b>709.2.</b></a> Although split cards have two castable halves, each split card is only one card. For example, a player who has drawn or discarded a split card has drawn or discarded one card, not two.</p>
<p><a id="cr709.3"><b>709.3.</b></a> A player chooses which half of a split card they are casting before putting it onto the stack.</p>
<p><a id="cr709.3a"><b>709.3a</b></a> Only the chosen half is evaluated to see if it can be cast. Only that half is considered to be put onto the stack.</p>
<p><a id="cr709.3b"><b>709.3b</b></a> While on the stack, only the characteristics of the half being cast exist. The other half’s characteristics are treated as though they didn’t exist.</p>
<p><a id="cr709.3c"><b>709.3c</b></a> An effect may create a copy of a split card and allow a player to cast the copy. That copy retains the characteristics of the two halves separated into the same two halves as the original card. (See rule <a href="#cr707.12">707.12</a>.)</p>
<p><a id="cr709.4"><b>709.4.</b></a> In every zone except the stack, the characteristics of a split card are those of its two halves combined. This is a change from previous rules.</p>
<p><a id="cr709.4a"><b>709.4a</b></a> Each split card has two names. If an effect instructs a player to choose a card name and the player wants to choose a split card’s name, the player must choose one of those names and not both. An object has the chosen name if one of its names is the chosen name.</p>
<p><a id="cr709.4b"><b>709.4b</b></a> The mana cost of a split card is the combined mana costs of its two halves. A split card’s colors and mana value are determined from its combined mana cost. An effect that refers specifically to the symbols in a split card’s mana cost sees the separate symbols rather than the whole mana cost.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Assault//Battery’s mana cost is {3}{R}{G}. It’s a red and green card with a mana value of 5. If you cast Assault, the resulting spell is a red spell with a mana value of 1.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Fire//Ice’s mana cost is {2}{U}{R}. It has the same mana cost as Steam Augury, but an effect such as that of Jegantha, the Wellspring sees that it contains the mana symbol {1} twice.</p>
<p><a id="cr709.4c"><b>709.4c</b></a> A split card has each card type specified on either of its halves and each ability in the text box of each half.</p>
<p><a id="cr709.4d"><b>709.4d</b></a> The characteristics of a fused split spell on the stack are also those of its two halves combined (see rule <a href="#cr702.102">702.102</a>, “Fuse”).</p>
<p><a id="cr710"><b>710. Flip Cards</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr710.1"><b>710.1.</b></a> Flip cards have a two-part card frame on a single card. The text that appears right side up on the card defines the card’s normal characteristics. Additional alternative characteristics appear upside down on the card. The back of a flip card is the normal Magic card back.</p>
<p><a id="cr710.1a"><b>710.1a</b></a> The top half of a flip card contains the card’s normal name, text box, type line, power, and toughness. The text box usually contains an ability that causes the permanent to “flip” if certain conditions are met.</p>
<p><a id="cr710.1b"><b>710.1b</b></a> The bottom half of a flip card contains an alternative name, text box, type line, power, and toughness. These characteristics are used only if the permanent is on the battlefield and only if the permanent is flipped.</p>
<p><a id="cr710.1c"><b>710.1c</b></a> A flip card’s color and mana cost don’t change if the permanent is flipped. Also, any changes to it by external effects will still apply.</p>
<p><a id="cr710.2"><b>710.2.</b></a> In every zone other than the battlefield, and also on the battlefield before the permanent flips, a flip card has only the normal characteristics of the card. Once a permanent is flipped, its normal name, text box, type line, power, and toughness don’t apply and the alternative versions of those characteristics apply instead.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Akki Lavarunner is a nonlegendary creature that flips into a legendary creature named Tok-Tok, Volcano Born. An effect that says “Search your library for a legendary card” can’t find this flip card. An effect that says “Legendary creatures get +2/+2” doesn’t affect Akki Lavarunner, but it does affect Tok-Tok.</p>
<p><a id="cr710.3"><b>710.3.</b></a> You must ensure that it’s clear at all times whether a permanent you control is flipped or not, both when it’s untapped and when it’s tapped. Common methods for distinguishing between flipped and unflipped permanents include using coins or dice to mark flipped objects.</p>
<p><a id="cr710.4"><b>710.4.</b></a> Flipping a permanent is a one-way process. Once a permanent is flipped, it’s impossible for it to become unflipped. However, if a flipped permanent leaves the battlefield, it retains no memory of its status. See rule <a href="#cr110.5">110.5</a>.</p>
<p><a id="cr710.5"><b>710.5.</b></a> If an effect instructs a player to choose a card name and the player wants to choose a flip card’s alternative name, the player may do so.</p>
<p><a id="cr711"><b>711. Leveler Cards</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr711.1"><b>711.1.</b></a> Each leveler card has a striated text box and three power/toughness boxes. The text box of a leveler card contains two level symbols.</p>
<p><a id="cr711.2"><b>711.2.</b></a> A level symbol is a keyword ability that represents a static ability. The level symbol includes either a range of numbers, indicated here as “N1-N2,” or a single number followed by a plus sign, indicated here as “N3+.” Any abilities printed within the same text box striation as a level symbol are part of its static ability.

<p><a id="cr711.3"><b>711.3.</b></a> The text box striations have no game significance other than clearly demarcating which abilities and which power/toughness box are associated with which level symbol. Leveler cards each contain only one text box.</p>
<p><a id="cr711.4"><b>711.4.</b></a> Any ability a leveler card has that isn’t preceded by a level symbol is treated normally. In particular, each leveler permanent has its level up ability (see rule <a href="#cr702.87">702.87</a>) at all times; it may be activated regardless of how many level counters are on that permanent.</p>
<p><a id="cr711.5"><b>711.5.</b></a> If the number of level counters on a leveler creature is less than N1 (the first number printed in its {LEVEL N1-N2} symbol), it has the power and toughness denoted by its uppermost power/toughness box.</p>

<p><a id="cr712"><b>712. Double-Faced Cards</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr712.1"><b>712.1.</b></a> A double-faced card has a Magic card face on each side rather than a Magic card face on one side and a Magic card back on the other. There are two kinds of double-faced cards. Transforming double-faced cards include abilities on one or both of their faces that allow the card to “transform” (turn over to its other face) or allow the card to be cast or enter the battlefield “transformed” (with its back face up). Modal double-faced cards have two faces that are independent from one another, and they can’t transform.</p>
<p><a id="cr712.1a"><b>712.1a</b></a> A transforming double-faced card’s front face is marked by a front-face symbol in its upper left corner. On Magic Origins® and Core Set 2019 double-faced cards, the front-face symbol is a modified Planeswalker icon. On cards in the Innistrad® block, Shadows over Innistrad set, and Innistrad: Midnight Hunt set, as well as on Ulrich of the Krallenhorde in the Eldritch Moon™ set, the front-face symbol is a sun. On other Eldritch Moon double-faced cards, the front-face symbol is a full moon. On Ixalan™ and Rivals of Ixalan™ cards, the front-face symbol is a compass rose.</p>
<p><a id="cr712.1b"><b>712.1b</b></a> A transforming double-faced card’s back face is marked by a back-face symbol in its upper left corner. On Magic Origins and Core Set 2019 double-faced cards, the back-face symbol is a full Planeswalker icon. On cards in the Innistrad block, Shadows over Innistrad set, and Innistrad: Midnight Hunt set, as well as on Ulrich, Uncontested Alpha in the Eldritch Moon set, the back-face symbol is a crescent moon. On other Eldritch Moon double-faced cards, the back-face symbol is a stylized image of Emrakul. On Ixalan and Rivals of Ixalan cards, the back-face symbol is a land icon.</p>
<p><a id="cr712.1c"><b>712.1c</b></a> The front face of a transforming double-faced card whose back face is a creature has the back face’s power and toughness printed in gray above the power and toughness box. This is reminder text and has no effect on game play.</p>
<p><a id="cr712.1d"><b>712.1d</b></a> A modal double-faced card’s front face is marked by a front-face symbol in its upper left corner. The front-face symbol is a single black triangle inside a sideways teardrop.</p>
<p><a id="cr712.1e"><b>712.1e</b></a> A modal double-faced card’s back face is marked by a back-face symbol in its upper left corner. The back-face symbol is two white triangles inside a sideways teardrop.</p>

<p><a id="cr712.1g"><b>712.1g</b></a> Meld cards have a Magic card face on one side and half of an oversized Magic card face on the other. These aren’t double-faced cards and are subject to their own set of rules. See rule <a href="#cr713">713</a>, “Meld Cards.”</p>
<p><a id="cr712.2"><b>712.2.</b></a> Players who are allowed to look at a double-faced card may look at both faces.</p>
<p><a id="cr712.3"><b>712.3.</b></a> Players must ensure that double-faced cards in hidden zones are indistinguishable from other cards in the same zone. To do this, the owner of a double-faced card may use completely opaque card sleeves and/or a substitute card (see rule <a href="#cr714">714</a>). Sanctioned tournaments have additional rules for playing with double-faced cards. See rule <a href="#cr100.6">100.6</a>.</p>
<p><a id="cr712.4"><b>712.4.</b></a> Each face of a double-faced card has its own set of characteristics.</p>

<p><a id="cr712.4b"><b>712.4b</b></a> Normally, a transforming double-faced spell has its front face up while on the stack and has only the characteristics of its front face. However, if an effect allows a player to cast a transforming double-faced card “transformed,” the resulting spell will have its back face up and have only the characteristics of its back face. Its mana value is calculated using the mana cost of its front face. A copy of a transforming double-faced spell with its back face up has mana value 0.</p>

<p><a id="cr712.4e"><b>712.4e</b></a> While a modal double-faced spell is on the stack or a modal double-faced permanent is on the battlefield, it has only the characteristics of the face that’s up.</p>
<p><a id="cr712.5"><b>712.5.</b></a> Only permanents represented by transforming double-faced cards can transform. (See rule <a href="#cr701.28">701.28</a>, “Transform.”) If a spell or ability instructs a player to transform any permanent that isn’t represented by a transforming double-faced card, nothing happens.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> A Clone enters the battlefield as a copy of Wildblood Pack (the back face of a transforming double-faced card). The Clone will be a copy of the Wildblood Pack. Because the Clone is itself not a transforming double-faced card, it can’t transform.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> A player casts Cytoshape, causing a Kruin Outlaw (the front face of a transforming double-faced card) to become a copy of Elite Vanguard (a 2/1 Human Soldier creature) until end of turn. The player then casts Moonmist, which reads, in part, “Transform all Humans.” Because the copy of Elite Vanguard is a transforming double-faced card, it will transform. The resulting permanent will have its back face up, but it will still be a copy of Elite Vanguard that turn.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> A player controls Blackbloom Rogue, a Human Rogue that’s the front face of a modal double-faced card. They cast Moonmist. Blackbloom Rogue doesn’t transform.</p>
<p><a id="cr712.6"><b>712.6.</b></a> If a spell or ability instructs a player to transform a permanent, and the face that permanent would transform into is represented by an instant or sorcery card face, nothing happens.</p>
<p><a id="cr712.7"><b>712.7.</b></a> If a transforming double-faced card is cast as a spell, it’s put on the stack with its front face up by default. If a transforming double-faced card is cast “transformed,” it’s put on the stack with its back face up. A player casting a modal double-faced card as a spell chooses which face they are casting before putting it onto the stack. See rule <a href="#cr601">601</a>, “Casting Spells.”</p>
<p><a id="cr712.7a"><b>712.7a</b></a> Only the face that will be face up on the stack is evaluated to determine if it can be cast. Only that face is considered to be put onto the stack.</p>
<p><a id="cr712.7b"><b>712.7b</b></a> If an ability of a transforming double-faced card’s front face allows it to be cast “transformed,” that ability is also considered when evaluating that spell to determine if it can be cast. This is an exception to 712.7a.</p>
<p><a id="cr712.8"><b>712.8.</b></a> A player playing a modal double-faced card as a land chooses one of its faces that’s a land before putting it onto the battlefield. It enters the battlefield with that face up. See rule <a href="#cr305">305</a>, “Lands.”</p>
<p><a id="cr712.9"><b>712.9.</b></a> By default, a resolving double-faced spell that becomes a permanent is put onto the battlefield with the same face up that was face up on the stack. Some abilities may cause a transforming double-faced spell with its front face up on the stack to enter the battlefield transformed.</p>
<p><a id="cr712.10"><b>712.10.</b></a> A double-faced card put onto the battlefield from a zone other than the stack enters the battlefield with its front face up by default.</p>
<p><a id="cr712.10a"><b>712.10a</b></a> If a spell or ability puts a transforming double-faced card onto the battlefield “transformed,” it enters the battlefield with its back face up.

<p><a id="cr712.10b"><b>712.10b</b></a> If a player is instructed to put a modal double-faced card onto the battlefield and its front face isn’t a permanent card, the card stays in its current zone.</p>
<p><a id="cr712.11"><b>712.11.</b></a> If an effect allows a player to cast a double-faced card as a face-down creature spell, or if a double-faced card enters the battlefield face down, it will have the characteristics given to it by the rule or effect that caused it to be face down. That card remains hidden, using a face-down substitute card (see rule <a href="#cr714">714</a>) and/or opaque sleeves. See rule <a href="#cr708">708</a>, “Face-Down Spells and Permanents.”</p>
<p><a id="cr712.11a"><b>712.11a</b></a> While face down, a transforming double-faced permanent can’t transform. If it’s turned face up, it will have its front face up.</p>

<p><a id="cr712.13"><b>712.13.</b></a> A double-faced card that is exiled face down remains hidden, using a face-down substitute card and/or opaque sleeves. See rule <a href="#cr714">714</a>, “Substitute Cards.”</p>
<p><a id="cr712.14"><b>712.14.</b></a> When a transforming double-faced permanent transforms, it doesn’t become a new object. Any effects that applied to that permanent will continue to apply to it after it transforms.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> An effect gives Village Ironsmith (the front face of a transforming double-faced card) +2/+2 until end of turn and then Village Ironsmith transforms into Ironfang. Ironfang will continue to get +2/+2 until end of turn.</p>
<p><a id="cr712.15"><b>712.15.</b></a> If an effect instructs a player to choose a card name, the player may name either face of a double-faced card but not both.</p>
<p><a id="cr712.16"><b>712.16.</b></a> If a transforming double-faced card would have an “As [this permanent] transforms . . .” ability after it transforms, that ability is applied while that permanent is transforming, not afterward.</p>
<p><a id="cr713"><b>713. Meld Cards</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr713.1"><b>713.1.</b></a> A meld card has a Magic card face on one side and half of an oversized Magic card face on the other. It doesn’t have a Magic card back.</p>
<p><a id="cr713.1a"><b>713.1a</b></a> There are three specific meld pairs. Each meld pair consists of two specific cards whose back faces combine to form one oversized Magic card face: Midnight Scavengers and Graf Rats meld to form Chittering Host; Hanweir Garrison and Hanweir Battlements meld to form Hanweir, the Writhing Township; and Bruna, the Fading Light and Gisela, the Broken Blade meld to form Brisela, Voice of Nightmares.</p>
<p><a id="cr713.1b"><b>713.1b</b></a> A meld card isn’t a double-faced card. Its back face can’t be cast or put onto the battlefield, and it can’t transform or enter the battlefield transformed. (See rule <a href="#cr712">712</a>, “Double-Faced Cards.”)</p>
<p><a id="cr713.2"><b>713.2.</b></a> One card in each meld pair has an ability that exiles both that object and its counterpart and melds them. To meld the two cards in a meld pair, put them onto the battlefield with their back faces up and combined (see rule <a href="#cr701.37">701.37</a>, “Meld”). The resulting permanent is a single object represented by two cards.</p>
<p><a id="cr713.3"><b>713.3.</b></a> The front face of each meld card and the combined face formed by a meld pair each has its own set of characteristics.</p>
<p><a id="cr713.3a"><b>713.3a</b></a> While a meld card is outside the game, in a zone other than the battlefield, or on the battlefield with its front face up, it has only the characteristics of its front face.</p>
<p><a id="cr713.3b"><b>713.3b</b></a> While the two cards of a meld pair are on the battlefield as a melded permanent, the object represented by those cards has only the characteristics of the combined back face, and its mana value is the sum of the mana values of its front faces.

<p><a id="cr713.4"><b>713.4.</b></a> If a melded permanent leaves the battlefield, one permanent leaves the battlefield and two cards are put into the appropriate zone.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Chittering Host, a melded permanent, dies.

<p><a id="cr713.4a"><b>713.4a</b></a> If a melded permanent is put into its owner’s graveyard or library, that player may arrange the two cards in any order. If it’s put into its owner’s library, that player doesn’t reveal the order.</p>
<p><a id="cr713.4b"><b>713.4b</b></a> If a player exiles a melded permanent, that player determines the relative timestamp order of the two cards at that time. This is an exception to the procedure described in rule <a href="#cr613.7k">613.7k</a>.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Duplicant is a card with the abilities “When Duplicant enters the battlefield, you may exile target nontoken creature” and “As long as a card exiled with Duplicant is a creature card, Duplicant has the power, toughness, and creature types of the last creature card exiled with Duplicant. It’s still a Shapeshifter.” As Duplicant’s first ability exiles Chittering Host, a melded permanent, Duplicant’s controller chooses whether the last creature card exiled is Midnight Scavengers or Graf Rats.</p>
<p><a id="cr713.4c"><b>713.4c</b></a> If an effect can find the new object that a melded permanent becomes as it leaves the battlefield, it finds both cards. (See rule <a href="#cr400.7">400.7</a>.) If that effect causes actions to be taken upon those cards, the same actions are taken upon each of them.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Otherworldly Journey is an instant that reads “Exile target creature. At the beginning of the next end step, return that card to the battlefield under its owner’s control with a +1/+1 counter on it.” A player casts Otherworldly Journey targeting Chittering Host, a melded permanent. Chittering Host is exiled. At the beginning of the next end step, Midnight Scavengers and Graf Rats are both returned to the battlefield, each with a +1/+1 counter on it.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> False Demise is an Aura with the ability “When enchanted creature dies, return that card to the battlefield under your control.” A Chittering Host enchanted by False Demise dies. The triggered ability returns both Midnight Scavengers and Graf Rats to the battlefield.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Mimic Vat is an artifact that reads, in part, “Whenever a nontoken creature dies, you may exile that card.” A Chittering Host dies. As Mimic Vat’s triggered ability resolves, its controller makes a single choice and both cards that represented Chittering Host are either exiled or not.</p>
<p><a id="cr713.4d"><b>713.4d</b></a> If multiple replacement effects could be applied to the event of a melded permanent leaving the battlefield or being put into the new zone, applying one of those replacement effects to one of the two cards affects both cards. If the melded permanent is a commander, it may be exempt from this rule; see rule <a href="#cr903.9a">903.9a</a>.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Leyline of the Void is an enchantment that reads, in part, “If a card would be put into an opponent’s graveyard from anywhere, exile it instead.” Wheel of Sun and Moon is an Aura with enchant player and the ability “If a card would be put into enchanted player’s graveyard from anywhere, instead that card is revealed and put on the bottom of its owner’s library.” If the controller of Chittering Host is affected by both cards’ effects, that player chooses one effect to apply to the event and Midnight Scavengers and Graf Rats are both moved to the appropriate zone.</p>
<p><a id="cr713.4e"><b>713.4e</b></a> If an effect needs to know the number of objects that changed zones, a melded permanent among those objects counts as one object that moved. If the effect needs to know the number of cards that changed zones, that melded permanent counts as two cards that moved.</p>
<p><a id="cr713.5"><b>713.5.</b></a> Players who are allowed to look at a meld card may look at its half of the combined back face. Players may access Oracle text for the other member of the meld pair and the combined face at any time (see rule <a href="#cr108.1">108.1</a>).</p>

<p><a id="cr714"><b>714. Substitute Cards</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr714.1"><b>714.1.</b></a> A substitute card is a game supplement that can be used to represent a double-faced card or meld card. A substitute card has a normal Magic card back.</p>
<p><a id="cr714.2"><b>714.2.</b></a> Each substitute card must clearly indicate the name of at least the front face of the card that it represents. Other information from the printed card (e.g. card type, mana cost, and power and toughness) may also be written on the substitute card.</p>
<p><a id="cr714.2a"><b>714.2a</b></a> Some substitute cards list the names and mana costs of the cards they can represent. Exactly one of the fill-in circles must be marked to denote which card the substitute card represents. This style of substitute card was found in Magic products that released 2011–2018.</p>
<p><a id="cr714.2b"><b>714.2b</b></a> Some substitute cards represent one specific listed card. This style of substitute card was found in the Core Set 2019 release, and it represents the card Nicol Bolas, the Ravager.</p>
<p><a id="cr714.2c"><b>714.2c</b></a> Some substitute cards can represent any modal double-faced card. These substitute cards include the front-face and back-face symbols on the front face of the card. To use one of them, write in the name of each face of the card it represents. This style of substitute card is found in the Zendikar Rising release.</p>
<p><a id="cr714.3"><b>714.3.</b></a> If a substitute card is used in a deck, the card it represents is set aside prior to the beginning of the game (see rule <a href="#cr103.2a">103.2a</a>) and must remain available throughout the game. A substitute card can’t be included in a deck unless it is representing a double-faced card or a meld card.</p>
<p><a id="cr714.4"><b>714.4.</b></a> For all game purposes, the substitute card is considered to be the card it’s representing.</p>
<p><a id="cr714.5"><b>714.5.</b></a> If the substitute card is face up in a public zone, it should be set aside and the double-faced card or meld card that it represents should be used instead.</p>
<p><a id="cr715"><b>715. Saga Cards</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr715.1"><b>715.1.</b></a> Each Saga card has a striated text box containing a number of chapter symbols. Its illustration is vertically oriented on the right side of the card, and its type line is along the bottom of the card.</p>
<p><a id="cr715.2"><b>715.2.</b></a> A chapter symbol is a keyword ability that represents a triggered ability referred to as a chapter ability.</p>
<p><a id="cr715.2a"><b>715.2a</b></a> A chapter symbol includes a Roman numeral, indicated here as “{rN}.” The numeral I represents 1, II represents 2, III represents 3, and so on.</p>
<p><a id="cr715.2b"><b>715.2b</b></a> “{rN}—[Effect]” means “When one or more lore counters are put onto this Saga, if the number of lore counters on it was less than N and became at least N, [effect].”</p>

<p><a id="cr715.2d"><b>715.2d</b></a> A Saga’s final chapter number is the greatest value among chapter abilities it has. If a Saga somehow has no chapter abilities, its final chapter number is 0.</p>
<p><a id="cr715.3"><b>715.3.</b></a> Sagas use lore counters to track their progress.</p>

<p><b>★</b> <a id="cr716.1"><b>716.1.</b></a> Page cards have a multi-part card frame, with one or more smaller frames inset within their text box.</p>
<p><b>★</b> <a id="cr716.2"><b>716.2.</b></a> The text that appears in the inset frame of a page card defines characteristics that may represent alternate characteristics of that object, or define characteristics for a new object related to the card.

<p><b>★</b> <a id="cr716.2a"><b>716.2a</b></a> If an effect refers to a card, spell, or permanent that “has a page,” it refers to an object for which these alternative characteristics exist, even if the object currently doesn’t use them.</p>
<p><b>★</b> <a id="cr716.2b"><b>716.2b</b></a> The existence and values of these alternative characteristics is part of the object’s copiable values.</p>
<p><b>★</b> <a id="cr716.2c"><b>716.2c</b></a> Although page cards are printed with multiple sets of characteristics, each page card is only one card. For example, a player who has drawn or discarded an page card has drawn or discarded one card, not two.</p>
<p><b>★</b> <a id="cr716.3"><b>716.3.</b></a> If an effect instructs a player to choose a card name and the player wants to choose an page card’s alternative name, the player may do so.</p>
<p><b>★</b> <a id="cr716.4"><b>716.4.</b></a> How the page card is used depends on the subtype or mechanic associated with it. Currently, there are two types of page cards, adventurer cards, which use the subtype Adventure, and tale cards, which use the subtype Tale.</p>
<p><b>★</b> <a id="cr716.5"><b>716.5.</b></a> A page card which has the Adventure subtype as an alternate characteristic is called an adventurer card.</p>
<p><b>★</b> <a id="cr716.5a"><b>716.5a</b></a> As a player casts an adventurer card, the player chooses whether they cast the card normally or as an Adventure.</p>
<p><b>★</b> <a id="cr716.5b"><b>716.5b</b></a> When casting an adventurer card as an Adventure, only the alternative characteristics are evaluated to see if it can be cast.</p>
<p><b>★</b> <a id="cr716.5c"><b>716.5c</b></a> While on the stack as an Adventure, the spell has only its alternative characteristics.</p>
<p><b>★</b> <a id="cr716.5d"><b>716.5d</b></a> If an Adventure spell is copied, the copy is also an Adventure. It has the alternative characteristics of the spell and not the normal characteristics of the card that represents the Adventure spell. Any rule or effect that refers to a spell cast as an Adventure refers to the copy as well.</p>
<p><b>★</b> <a id="cr716.5e"><b>716.5e</b></a> Instead of putting a spell that was cast as an Adventure into its owner’s graveyard as it resolves, its controller exiles it on an Adventure. For as long as that card remains exiled, that player may cast it.

<p><b>★</b> <a id="cr716.5f"><b>716.5f</b></a> In every zone except the stack, and while on the stack not as an Adventure, an adventurer card has only its normal characteristics.</p>
<p><b>★</b> <a id="cr716.6"><b>716.6.</b></a> A page card which has the Tale subtype as an alternate characteristic is called a tale card.</p>
<p><b>★</b> <a id="cr716.6a"><b>716.6a</b></a> A tale card never has the alternate characteristics of its inset card.

<p><b>★</b> <a id="cr716.6b"><b>716.6b</b></a> Casting a card's Tale works the same as casting any other spells, and additional and alternate costs may be paid for the spell.</p>
<p><b>★</b> <a id="cr716.6c"><b>716.6c</b></a> Once a permanent's Tale is cast, no Tales of that permanent can be cast for the rest of the game, even if the permanent somehow gains another Tale or temporarily loses its Tale.</p>
<p><b>★</b> <a id="cr716.6d"><b>716.6d</b></a> A Tale is not an ability of a card, but it is a property of the card, meaning the Tale of a permanent that has lost its abilities may be cast, and if another permanent becomes a copy of a permanent with a Tale, that Tale may be cast if that permanent hasn't had a Tale cast yet.</p>
<p><b>★</b> <a id="cr716.6e"><b>716.6e</b></a> If a Tale spell is copied, the copy is also a Tale.

<p><a id="cr717"><b>717. Class Cards</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr717.1"><b>717.1.</b></a> Each Class card has a striated text box containing two class level bars. Its illustration is vertically oriented on the left side of the card, and its type line is along the bottom of the card.</p>
<p><a id="cr717.2"><b>717.2.</b></a> A class level bar is a keyword ability that represents both an activated ability and a static ability. A class level bar includes the activation cost of its activated ability and a level number. Any abilities printed within the same text box section as the class level bar are part of its static ability.</p>
<p><a id="cr717.2a"><b>717.2a</b></a> “[Cost]: Level N — [Abilities]” means “[Cost]: This Class’s level becomes N. Activate only if this Class is level N-1 and only as a sorcery” and “As long as this Class is level N or greater, it has [abilities].”</p>
<p><a id="cr717.2b"><b>717.2b</b></a> A level is a designation that any permanent can have. A Class retains its level even if it stops being a Class. Levels are not a copiable characteristic.</p>
<p><a id="cr717.2c"><b>717.2c</b></a> The phrase “to gain a Class level” means “to activate an ability indicated by a class level bar”</p>
<p><a id="cr717.2d"><b>717.2d</b></a> If a rule or effect refers to a permanent’s level and that permanent doesn’t have a level, it is treated as though its level is 1.</p>
<p><a id="cr717.3"><b>717.3.</b></a> Any ability printed on a Class card that isn’t preceded by a class level bar is treated normally. In particular, the Class has the ability printed in its top text box section at all times. That ability may affect the game if it’s a static ability, it may trigger if it’s a triggered ability, and it can be activated if it’s an activated ability.</p>
<p><a id="cr717.4"><b>717.4.</b></a> Some older creature cards, called leveler cards, have level up abilities that add level counters to them. These are not the same as class level abilities. Level counters do not interact with Class cards, and class levels do not interact with leveler cards.

<p><a id="cr718.1"><b>718.1.</b></a> Some cards allow a player to control another player during that player’s next turn. This effect applies to the next turn that the affected player actually takes. The affected player is controlled during the entire turn; the effect doesn’t end until the beginning of the next turn.</p>
<p><a id="cr718.1a"><b>718.1a</b></a> Multiple player-controlling effects that affect the same player overwrite each other. The last one to be created is the one that works.</p>
<p><a id="cr718.1b"><b>718.1b</b></a> If a turn is skipped, any pending player-controlling effects wait until the player who would be affected actually takes a turn.</p>
<p><a id="cr718.2"><b>718.2.</b></a> Two cards (Word of Command and Opposition Agent) allow a player to control another player for a limited duration.</p>
<p><a id="cr718.3"><b>718.3.</b></a> Only control of the player changes. All objects are controlled by their normal controllers. A player who’s being controlled during their turn is still the active player.</p>
<p><a id="cr718.4"><b>718.4.</b></a> If information about an object in the game would be visible to the player being controlled, it’s visible to both that player and the controller of the player. If information about cards outside the game would be visible to the player being controlled, it’s visible only to that player, not the controller of the player.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> The controller of a player can see that player’s hand and the face of any face-down creatures they control.</p>
<p><a id="cr718.5"><b>718.5.</b></a> While controlling another player, a player makes all choices and decisions the controlled player is allowed to make or is told to make by the rules or by any objects. This includes choices and decisions about what to play, and choices and decisions called for by spells and abilities.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> The controller of another player decides which spells that player casts and what those spells target, and makes any required decisions when those spells resolve.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> The controller of another player decides which of that player’s creatures attack, which player or planeswalker each one attacks, what the damage assignment order of the creatures that block them is (if any of the attacking creatures are blocked by multiple creatures), and how those attacking creatures assign their combat damage.</p>
<p><a id="cr718.5a"><b>718.5a</b></a> The controller of another player can use only that player’s resources (cards, mana, and so on) to pay costs for that player.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> If the controller of a player decides that the controlled player will cast a spell with an additional cost of discarding cards, the cards are discarded from the controlled player’s hand.</p>
<p><a id="cr718.5b"><b>718.5b</b></a> The controller of another player can’t make choices or decisions for that player that aren’t called for by the rules or by any objects. The controller also can’t make any choices or decisions for the player that would be called for by the tournament rules.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> The player who’s being controlled still decides if they will leave to visit the restroom, trade a card to someone else, agree to an intentional draw, or call a judge about an error or infraction.</p>

<p><a id="cr725"><b>725. Taking Shortcuts</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr725.1"><b>725.1.</b></a> When playing a game, players typically make use of mutually understood shortcuts rather than explicitly identifying each game choice (either taking an action or passing priority) a player makes.</p>
<p><a id="cr725.1a"><b>725.1a</b></a> The rules for taking shortcuts are largely informal. As long as each player in the game understands the intent of each other player, any shortcut system they use is acceptable.</p>
<p><a id="cr725.1b"><b>725.1b</b></a> Occasionally the game gets into a state in which a set of actions could be repeated indefinitely (thus creating a “loop”). In that case, the shortcut rules can be used to determine how many times those actions are repeated without having to actually perform them, and how the loop is broken.</p>
<p><a id="cr725.1c"><b>725.1c</b></a> Tournaments use a modified version of the rules governing shortcuts and loops. These rules are covered in the Magic: The Gathering Tournament Rules (found at WPN.Wizards.com/en/resources/rules-documents). Whenever the Tournament Rules contradict these rules during a tournament, the Tournament Rules take precedence.</p>
<p><a id="cr725.2"><b>725.2.</b></a> Taking a shortcut follows the following procedure.</p>
<p><a id="cr725.2a"><b>725.2a</b></a> At any point in the game, the player with priority may suggest a shortcut by describing a sequence of game choices, for all players, that may be legally taken based on the current game state and the predictable results of the sequence of choices. This sequence may be a non-repetitive series of choices, a loop that repeats a specified number of times, multiple loops, or nested loops, and may even cross multiple turns. It can’t include conditional actions, where the outcome of a game event determines the next action a player takes. The ending point of this sequence must be a place where a player has priority, though it need not be the player proposing the shortcut.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> A player controls a creature enchanted by Presence of Gond, which grants the creature the ability “{T}: Create a 1/1 green Elf Warrior creature token,” and another player controls Intruder Alarm, which reads, in part, “Whenever a creature enters the battlefield, untap all creatures.” When the player has priority, they may suggest “I’ll create a million tokens,” indicating the sequence of activating the creature’s ability, all players passing priority, letting the creature’s ability resolve and create a token (which causes Intruder Alarm’s ability to trigger), Intruder Alarm’s controller putting that triggered ability on the stack, all players passing priority, Intruder Alarm’s triggered ability resolving, all players passing priority until the player proposing the shortcut has priority, and repeating that sequence 999,999 more times, ending just after the last token-creating ability resolves.</p>
<p><a id="cr725.2b"><b>725.2b</b></a> Each other player, in turn order starting after the player who suggested the shortcut, may either accept the proposed sequence, or shorten it by naming a place where they will make a game choice that’s different than what’s been proposed. (The player doesn’t need to specify at this time what the new choice will be.) This place becomes the new ending point of the proposed sequence.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> The active player draws a card during her draw step, then says, “Go.” The nonactive player is holding Into the Fray (an instant that says “Target creature attacks this turn if able”) and says, “I’d like to cast a spell during your beginning of combat step.” The current proposed shortcut is that all players pass priority at all opportunities during the turn until the nonactive player has priority during the beginning of combat step.</p>
<p><a id="cr725.2c"><b>725.2c</b></a> Once the last player has either accepted or shortened the shortcut proposal, the shortcut is taken. The game advances to the last proposed ending point, with all game choices contained in the shortcut proposal having been taken. If the shortcut was shortened from the original proposal, the player who now has priority must make a different game choice than what was originally proposed for that player.</p>
<p><a id="cr725.3"><b>725.3.</b></a> Sometimes a loop can be fragmented, meaning that each player involved in the loop performs an independent action that results in the same game state being reached multiple times. If that happens, the active player (or, if the active player is not involved in the loop, the first player in turn order who is involved) must then make a different game choice so the loop does not continue.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> In a two-player game, the active player controls a creature with the ability “{0}: [This creature] gains flying,” the nonactive player controls a permanent with the ability “{0}: Target creature loses flying,” and nothing in the game cares how many times an ability has been activated. Say the active player activates his creature’s ability, it resolves, then the nonactive player activates her permanent’s ability targeting that creature, and it resolves. This returns the game to a game state it was at before. The active player must make a different game choice (in other words, anything other than activating that creature’s ability again). The creature doesn’t have flying. Note that the nonactive player could have prevented the fragmented loop simply by not activating her permanent’s ability, in which case the creature would have had flying. The nonactive player always has the final choice and is therefore able to determine whether the creature has flying.</p>
<p><a id="cr725.4"><b>725.4.</b></a> If a loop contains only mandatory actions, the game is a draw. (See rules <a href="#cr104.4b">104.4b</a> and <a href="#cr104.4f">104.4f</a>.)</p>
<p><a id="cr725.5"><b>725.5.</b></a> No player can be forced to perform an action that would end a loop other than actions called for by objects involved in the loop.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> A player controls Seal of Cleansing, an enchantment that reads, “Sacrifice Seal of Cleansing: Destroy target artifact or enchantment.” A mandatory loop that involves an artifact begins. The player is not forced to sacrifice Seal of Cleansing to destroy the artifact and end the loop.</p>
<p><a id="cr725.6"><b>725.6.</b></a> If a loop contains an effect that says “[A] unless [B],” where [A] and [B] are each actions, no player can be forced to perform [B] to break the loop. If no player chooses to perform [B], the loop will continue as though [A] were mandatory.</p>
<p><a id="cr726"><b>726. Handling Illegal Actions</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr726.1"><b>726.1.</b></a> If a player takes an illegal action or starts to take an action but can’t legally complete it, the entire action is reversed and any payments already made are canceled. No abilities trigger and no effects apply as a result of an undone action. If the action was casting a spell, the spell returns to the zone it came from. Each player may also reverse any legal mana abilities that player activated while making the illegal play, unless mana from those abilities or from any triggered mana abilities they caused to trigger was spent on another mana ability that wasn’t reversed. Players may not reverse actions that moved cards to a library, moved cards from a library to any zone other than the stack, caused a library to be shuffled, or caused cards from a library to be revealed.</p>
<p><a id="cr726.2"><b>726.2.</b></a> When reversing illegal spells and abilities, the player who had priority retains it and may take another action or pass. The player may redo the reversed action in a legal way or take any other action allowed by the rules.</p>

<p><b>★</b> <a id="cr727.3a"><b>727.3a</b></a> If a player would draw multiple cards at once, each card draw is chosen separately.</p>
<p><b>★</b> <a id="cr727.4"><b>727.4.</b></a> If a cost or nonstatic effect would refer to a player's undefined library and that player has multiple libraries, that effect's controller chooses any library that player has upon resolution and the effect is applied to that library. If that effect has no controller, that player chooses the library instead.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Enlightened Tutor will shuffle the same library that was searched, and put the found card on top of that same library.</p>

<a id="cr8"><b>8. Multiplayer Rules</b></a><p><a id="cr800"><b>800. General</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr800.1"><b>800.1.</b></a> A multiplayer game is a game that begins with more than two players. This section contains additional optional rules that can be used for multiplayer play.</p>
<p><a id="cr800.2"><b>800.2.</b></a> These rules consist of a series of options that can be added to a multiplayer game and a number of variant styles of multiplayer play. A single game may use multiple options but only one variant.</p>
<p><a id="cr800.3"><b>800.3.</b></a> Many multiplayer Magic tournaments have additional rules not included here, including rules for deck construction. See the most current Magic: The Gathering Tournament Rules for more information. They can be found at WPN.Wizards.com/en/resources/rules-documents.</p>
<p><a id="cr800.4"><b>800.4.</b></a> Unlike two-player games, multiplayer games can continue after one or more players have left the game.</p>
<p><a id="cr800.4a"><b>800.4a</b></a> When a player leaves the game, all objects (see rule <a href="#cr109">109</a>) owned by that player leave the game and any effects which give that player control of any objects or players end. Then, if that player controlled any objects on the stack not represented by cards, those objects cease to exist. Then, if there are any objects still controlled by that player, those objects are exiled. This is not a state-based action. It happens as soon as the player leaves the game. If the player who left the game had priority at the time they left, priority passes to the next player in turn order who’s still in the game.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Alex casts Mind Control, an Aura that reads, “You control enchanted creature,” on Bianca’s Assault Griffin. If Alex leaves the game, so does Mind Control, and Assault Griffin reverts to Bianca’s control. If, instead, Bianca leaves the game, so does Assault Griffin, and Mind Control is put into Alex’s graveyard.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Alex casts Act of Treason, which reads, in part, “Gain control of target creature until end of turn,” targeting Bianca’s Runeclaw Bears. If Alex leaves the game, Act of Treason’s change-of-control effect ends and Runeclaw Bears reverts to Bianca’s control.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Alex casts Bribery, which reads, “Search target opponent’s library for a creature card and put that card onto the battlefield under your control. Then that player shuffles their library,” targeting Bianca. Alex puts Serra Angel onto the battlefield from Bianca’s library. If Bianca leaves the game, Serra Angel also leaves the game. If, instead, Alex leaves the game, Serra Angel is exiled.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Alex controls Genesis Chamber, which reads, “Whenever a nontoken creature enters the battlefield, if Genesis Chamber is untapped, that creature’s controller creates a 1/1 colorless Myr artifact creature token.” If Alex leaves the game, all such Myr tokens that entered the battlefield under Alex’s control leave the game, and all such Myr tokens that entered the battlefield under any other player’s control remain in the game.</p>
<p><a id="cr800.4b"><b>800.4b</b></a> If an object would change to the control of a player who has left the game, it doesn’t. If a token would be created under the control of a player who has left the game, no token is created. If an object would be put onto the battlefield or onto the stack under the control of a player who has left the game, that object remains in its current zone. If a player would be controlled by a player who has left the game, they aren’t.</p>
<p><a id="cr800.4c"><b>800.4c</b></a> If an effect that gives a player still in the game control of an object ends, there is no other effect giving control of that object to another player in the game, and the player who controlled that object by default has left the game, the object is exiled. This is not a state-based action. It happens as soon as the control-changing effect ends.</p>
<p><a id="cr800.4d"><b>800.4d</b></a> If an object that would be owned by a player who has left the game would be created in any zone, it isn’t created. If a triggered ability that would be controlled by a player who has left the game would be put onto the stack, it isn’t put on the stack.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Astral Slide is an enchantment that reads, “Whenever a player cycles a card, you may exile target creature. If you do, return that creature to the battlefield under its owner’s control at the beginning of the next end step.” During Alex’s turn, Bianca uses Astral Slide’s ability to exile Alex’s Hypnotic Specter. Before the end of that turn, Bianca leaves the game. At the beginning of the end step, the delayed triggered ability generated by Astral Slide that would return Hypnotic Specter to the battlefield triggers, but it isn’t put on the stack. Hypnotic Specter never returns to the battlefield.</p>
<p><a id="cr800.4e"><b>800.4e</b></a> If combat damage would be assigned to a player who has left the game, that damage isn’t assigned.</p>
<p><a id="cr800.4f"><b>800.4f</b></a> If an object requires a player who has left the game to pay a cost or choose whether to pay a cost, that cost is not paid.</p>
<p><a id="cr800.4g"><b>800.4g</b></a> If an object requires a player who has left the game to make a choice other than whether to pay a cost, the controller of the object chooses another player to make that choice. If the original choice was to be made by an opponent of the controller of the object, that player chooses another opponent if possible.</p>
<p><a id="cr800.4h"><b>800.4h</b></a> If a rule requires a player who has left the game to make a choice, the next player in turn order makes that choice.</p>
<p><a id="cr800.4i"><b>800.4i</b></a> If an effect requires information about a specific player, the effect uses the current information about that player if they are still in the game; otherwise, the effect uses the last known information about that player before they left the game. If an effect requires information from the game about actions players have taken, the effect can find actions that were taken by a player who has left the game.</p>
<p><a id="cr800.4j"><b>800.4j</b></a> If a player leaves the game during their turn, that turn continues to its completion without an active player. If the active player would receive priority, instead the next player in turn order receives priority, or the top object on the stack resolves, or the phase or step ends, whichever is appropriate.</p>
<p><a id="cr800.4k"><b>800.4k</b></a> If a player who has left the game would begin a turn, that turn doesn’t begin.</p>
<p><a id="cr800.4m"><b>800.4m</b></a> When a player leaves the game, any continuous effects with durations that last until that player’s next turn or until a specific point in that turn will last until that turn would have begun. They neither expire immediately nor last indefinitely.</p>
<p><a id="cr800.4n"><b>800.4n</b></a> When a player leaves the game, objects that player owns in the ante zone do not leave the game. This is an exception to rule <a href="#cr800.4a">800.4a</a>. See rule <a href="#cr407">407</a>, “Ante.”</p>
<p><a id="cr800.4p"><b>800.4p</b></a> In a Planechase game, if the player designated as the planar controller would leave the game, instead the next player in turn order that wouldn’t leave the game becomes the planar controller, then the old planar controller leaves the game. See rule <a href="#cr310.5">310.5</a>.</p>
<p><a id="cr800.5"><b>800.5.</b></a> Unless a chosen variant or option prescribes otherwise, seating order is determined by any mutually agreeable method. For example, players could agree to remain where they were before the game began, roll dice to determine seating order, and so on.</p>
<p><a id="cr800.6"><b>800.6.</b></a> In a multiplayer game, the first mulligan a player takes doesn’t count toward the number of cards that player will put on the bottom of their library or the number of mulligans that player may take. Subsequent mulligans are counted toward these numbers as normal.</p>
<p><a id="cr800.7"><b>800.7.</b></a> In a multiplayer game other than a Two-Headed Giant game, the starting player doesn’t skip the draw step of their first turn. In a Two-Headed Giant game, the team who plays first skips the draw step of their first turn. See rule <a href="#cr103.7">103.7</a>.</p>
<p><a id="cr801"><b>801. Limited Range of Influence Option</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr801.1"><b>801.1.</b></a> Limited range of influence is an option that can be applied to most multiplayer games. It’s always used in the Emperor variant (see rule <a href="#cr809">809</a>), and it’s often used for games involving five or more players.</p>
<p><a id="cr801.2"><b>801.2.</b></a> A player’s range of influence is the maximum distance from that player, measured in player seats, that the player can affect. Players within that many seats of the player are within that player’s range of influence. Objects controlled by players within a player’s range of influence are also within that player’s range of influence. Range of influence covers spells, abilities, effects, damage dealing, attacking, making choices, and winning the game.</p>
<p><a id="cr801.2a"><b>801.2a</b></a> The most commonly chosen limited ranges of influence are 1 seat and 2 seats. Different players may have different ranges of influence.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> A range of influence of 1 means that only you and the players seated directly next to you are within your range of influence.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> A range of influence of 2 means that you and the two players to your left and the two players to your right are within your range of influence.</p>
<p><a id="cr801.2b"><b>801.2b</b></a> A player is always within their own range of influence.</p>
<p><a id="cr801.2c"><b>801.2c</b></a> The particular players within each player’s range of influence are determined as each turn begins.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> In a game with a range of influence of 1, Alex is seated to the left of Rob, and Carissa is seated to the right of Rob. Carissa is not in Alex’s range of influence. If Rob leaves the game, Carissa will enter Alex’s range of influence at the start of the next turn.</p>
<p><a id="cr801.2d"><b>801.2d</b></a> An object is within a player’s range of influence if it’s controlled by that player or by another player within that many seats of that player.</p>
<p><a id="cr801.3"><b>801.3.</b></a> Creatures can attack only opponents within their controller’s range of influence or planeswalkers controlled by those opponents. If no opponents are within a player’s range of influence, creatures that player controls can’t attack.</p>
<p><a id="cr801.4"><b>801.4.</b></a> Objects and players outside a player’s range of influence can’t be the targets of spells or abilities that player controls.</p>
<p><a id="cr801.5"><b>801.5.</b></a> Some cards require players to make choices. These cards work differently when the limited range of influence option is used.</p>
<p><a id="cr801.5a"><b>801.5a</b></a> If a player is asked to choose an object or player, they must choose one within their range of influence.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> In a game with a range of influence of 1, Alex is seated to the left of Rob. Alex activates the ability of Cuombajj Witches, which reads, “{T}: Cuombajj Witches deals 1 damage to any target and 1 damage to any target of an opponent’s choice,” targeting Rob and choosing Rob as the opponent who picks the other target. Rob must choose a target that’s in both his range of influence and in the range of influence of the controller of Cuombajj Witches. He must therefore choose himself, Alex, or a creature controlled by either himself or Alex.</p>
<p><a id="cr801.5b"><b>801.5b</b></a> If a player is asked to choose between one or more options (and not between one or more objects or players), they can choose between those options even if those options refer to objects or players outside the player’s range of influence.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Alex, who has a range of influence of 2, is seated to the left of Rob, and Carissa, who has a range of influence of 1, is seated to the right of Rob. Alex casts a spell that reads, “An opponent chooses one — You draw two cards; or each creature you control gets +2/+2 until end of turn,” and chooses Carissa to make that choice. Carissa can choose the mode even though Alex is out of her range.</p>
<p><a id="cr801.5c"><b>801.5c</b></a> If an effect requires a choice and there’s no player who can make that choice within its controller’s range of influence, the closest appropriate player to its controller’s left makes that choice.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> In an Emperor game in which all players have range of influence 1, an emperor casts Fact or Fiction, which reads, “Reveal the top five cards of your library. An opponent separates those cards into two piles. Put one pile into your hand and the other into your graveyard.” Since no opponent is within the emperor’s range of influence, the nearest opponent to the emperor’s left separates the cards into piles.</p>
<p><a id="cr801.6"><b>801.6.</b></a> A player can’t activate the activated abilities of an object outside of their range of influence.</p>
<p><a id="cr801.7"><b>801.7.</b></a> A triggered ability doesn’t trigger unless its trigger event happens entirely within the range of influence of its source’s controller.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> In a game in which all players have range of influence 1, Alex is seated to the left of Rob. Rob controls two Auras attached to Alex’s Runeclaw Bear: One with the trigger condition “Whenever enchanted creature becomes blocked,” and one with the trigger condition “Whenever enchanted creature becomes blocked by a creature.” Alex’s Runeclaw Bear attacks the player to Alex’s left and becomes blocked. The ability of Rob’s first Aura triggers because the entire event (Runeclaw Bear becomes blocked) happens within Rob’s range of influence. The ability of Rob’s second Aura doesn’t trigger, however, because that event includes the blocking creature, which is out of Rob’s range.</p>
<p><a id="cr801.7a"><b>801.7a</b></a> If a trigger event includes an object moving out of or into a player’s range of influence, use the game state before or after the event as appropriate to determine whether the triggered ability will trigger. See rules <a href="#cr603.6">603.6</a> and <a href="#cr603.10">603.10</a>.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Carissa and Alex are outside each other’s range of influence. Carissa controls a Runeclaw Bear owned by Alex and they each control an Extractor Demon, a creature which reads, in part, “Whenever another creature leaves the battlefield, you may have target player mill two cards.” The Runeclaw Bear is destroyed and is put into Alex’s graveyard. The ability of Alex’s Extractor Demon doesn’t trigger because the leaves-the-battlefield event was outside Alex’s range of influence. The ability of Carissa’s Extractor Demon does trigger, even though the creature is going to a graveyard outside her range, because the leaves-the-battlefield event was within her range.</p>
<p><a id="cr801.8"><b>801.8.</b></a> An Aura can’t enchant an object or player outside its controller’s range of influence. If an Aura is attached to an illegal object or player, the Aura is put into its owner’s graveyard as a state-based action. See rule <a href="#cr704.">704.</a></p>
<p><a id="cr801.9"><b>801.9.</b></a> An Equipment can’t equip an object outside its controller’s range of influence, and a Fortification can’t fortify an object outside its controller’s range of influence. If an Equipment or Fortification is attached to an illegal permanent, it becomes unattached from that permanent but remains on the battlefield. This is a state-based action. See rule <a href="#cr704.">704.</a></p>
<p><a id="cr801.10"><b>801.10.</b></a> Spells and abilities can’t affect objects or players outside their controller’s range of influence. The parts of the effect that attempt to affect an out-of-range object or player will do nothing. The rest of the effect will work normally.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> In a six-player game in which each player has range of influence 1, Alex casts Pyroclasm, which reads, “Pyroclasm deals 2 damage to each creature.” Pyroclasm deals 2 damage to each creature controlled by Alex, the player to Alex’s left, and the player to Alex’s right. No other creatures are dealt damage.</p>
<p><a id="cr801.11"><b>801.11.</b></a> If a spell or ability requires information from the game, it gets only information from within its controller’s range of influence. It doesn’t see objects or events outside its controller’s range of influence.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> In a six-player game where each player has range of influence 1, Alex controls Coat of Arms, which reads, “Each creature gets +1/+1 for each other creature on the battlefield that shares at least one creature type with it.” Coat of Arms will boost Alex’s creatures based only on what creatures are controlled by Alex, the player to Alex’s left, and the player to Alex’s right. It won’t take other creatures into account.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> In the same game, Rob is sitting to the right of Alex. Coat of Arms will boost Rob’s creatures based on what creatures are controlled by players within Alex’s range of influence, including the player sitting to Alex’s left, who’s out of Rob’s range of influence.</p>
<p><a id="cr801.12"><b>801.12.</b></a> The “world rule” (see rule <a href="#cr704.5k">704.5k</a>) applies to a permanent only if other world permanents are within its controller’s range of influence.</p>
<p><a id="cr801.13"><b>801.13.</b></a> Replacement and prevention effects watch for a particular event to happen and then completely or partially replace that event. The limited range of influence option can cause the modified event to contain instructions that can’t be carried out, in which case the player simply ignores the impossible instructions. See rule <a href="#cr614">614</a>, “Replacement Effects,” and rule <a href="#cr615">615</a>, “Prevention Effects.”</p>
<p><a id="cr801.13a"><b>801.13a</b></a> If a replacement effect tries to cause a spell or ability to affect an object or player outside its controller’s range of influence, that portion of the event does nothing.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Alex casts Lava Axe (“Lava Axe deals 5 damage to target player or planeswalker.”) targeting Rob. In response, Rob casts Captain’s Maneuver (“The next X damage that would be dealt to target creature, planeswalker, or player this turn is dealt to another target creature, planeswalker, or player instead.”) with X equal to 3, targeting Carissa. Carissa isn’t in Alex’s range of influence. When Lava Axe resolves, it deals 2 damage to Rob and no damage to Carissa.</p>
<p><a id="cr801.13b"><b>801.13b</b></a> If a spell or ability creates an effect that prevents damage that would be dealt by a source, it can affect only sources within the spell or ability’s controller’s range of influence. If a spell or ability creates an effect that prevents damage that would be dealt to a permanent or player, it can affect only permanents and players within the spell or ability’s controller’s range of influence. If a spell or ability creates an effect that prevents damage, but neither the source nor the would-be recipient of the damage is specified, it prevents damage only if both the source and recipient of that damage are within the spell or ability’s controller’s range of influence.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Rob is within Alex’s range of influence, but Carissa is not. Alex controls an enchantment that says, “Prevent all damage that would be dealt by creatures.” Carissa attacks Rob with a creature. The creature deals combat damage to Rob.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Rob is within Alex’s range of influence, but Carissa is not. Carissa casts Lightning Blast (“Lightning Blast deals 4 damage to any target.”) targeting Rob. In response, Alex casts Mending Hands (“Prevent the next 4 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn.”) targeting Rob. The damage to Rob is prevented.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Rob is within Alex’s range of influence, but Carissa is not. Carissa attacks Rob with a creature, and Rob blocks with a creature. Alex casts Fog (“Prevent all combat damage that would be dealt this turn.”) Carissa and Rob’s creatures deal combat damage to each other.</p>
<p><a id="cr801.14"><b>801.14.</b></a> If an effect states that a player wins the game, all of that player’s opponents within that player’s range of influence lose the game instead.</p>
<p><a id="cr801.15"><b>801.15.</b></a> If the effect of a spell or ability states that the game is a draw, the game is a draw for that spell or ability’s controller and all players within that player’s range of influence. They leave the game. All remaining players continue to play the game.</p>
<p><a id="cr801.16"><b>801.16.</b></a> If the game somehow enters a “loop” of mandatory actions, repeating a sequence of events with no way to stop, the game is a draw for each player who controls an object that’s involved in that loop, as well as for each player within the range of influence of any of those players. They leave the game. All remaining players continue to play the game.</p>
<p><a id="cr801.17"><b>801.17.</b></a> Effects that restart the game (see rule <a href="#cr721">721</a>) are exempt from the limited range of influence option. All players in the game will be involved in the new game.</p>
<p><a id="cr801.18"><b>801.18.</b></a> In multiplayer Planechase games other than Grand Melee games, plane cards and phenomenon cards are exempt from the limited range of influence option.

If an ability of an attacking creature refers to a defending player, or a spell or ability refers to both an attacking creature and a defending player, then unless otherwise specified, the defending player it’s referring to is the player that creature is attacking, or the controller of the planeswalker that creature is attacking. If that creature is no longer attacking, the defending player it’s referring to is the player that creature was attacking before it was removed from combat or the controller of the planeswalker that creature was attacking before it was removed from combat. If a spell or ability could apply to multiple attacking creatures, the appropriate defending player is individually determined for each of those attacking creatures. If there are multiple defending players that could be chosen, the controller of the spell or ability chooses one.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Rob attacks Alex with Runeclaw Bear and attacks Carissa with a creature with mountainwalk. Whether the creature with mountainwalk can be blocked depends only on whether Carissa controls a Mountain.</p>

<p><a id="cr807.4a"><b>807.4a</b></a> There is one turn marker for each full four players in the game.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> A Grand Melee game with sixteen players has four turn markers. A game with fifteen players has three turn markers.</p>

<p><a id="cr807.4c"><b>807.4c</b></a> After a player ends their turn, that player passes the turn marker to the player on their left.

<p><a id="cr807.4d"><b>807.4d</b></a> A player who receives a turn marker can’t begin their turn if any player in the three seats to their left has a turn marker. If this is the case, that player waits until the player four seats to their left takes the other turn marker.</p>
<p><a id="cr807.4e"><b>807.4e</b></a> If a player leaves the game and that player leaving the game would reduce the number of turn markers in the game, the turn marker immediately to the departed player’s right is designated for removal. If more than one player leaves the game simultaneously, those players leaving the game would reduce the number of turn markers in the game, and there are multiple turn markers that could be removed, the marker with the lowest number is designated for removal.

<p><a id="cr807.4g"><b>807.4g</b></a> If a player who’s taking a turn has a turn marker that’s been designated for removal, that turn marker is removed rather than being passed after that turn ends.

If a turn marker is within three seats on the player’s left, the extra turn waits to begin until the player four seats to their left takes the other turn marker. If a turn marker is within three seats on the player’s right, the player passes the turn marker to their left when the turn ends rather than keeping it, and the player will take the extra turn immediately before their next turn.</p>
<p><a id="cr807.4j"><b>807.4j</b></a> If an effect would cause a player to take an extra turn after the current turn, but that player wouldn’t have a turn marker at the start of that turn, that player will take the extra turn immediately before their next turn instead.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> During Alex’s turn, he casts Time Walk, which causes him to take an extra turn after this one. During the same turn, the player to Alex’s left leaves the game, which causes the number of turn markers to be reduced. After Alex’s current turn ends, his turn marker is removed. He won’t take the extra turn from Time Walk until just before his normal turn the next time he receives a turn marker.</p>
<p><a id="cr807.5"><b>807.5.</b></a> Rather than having a single stack, Grand Melee games contain multiple stacks. Each turn marker represents its own stack.</p>
<p><a id="cr807.5a"><b>807.5a</b></a> A player gets priority for a particular turn marker’s stack only if the turn marker is within their range of influence or an object on that stack is controlled by a player within their range of influence.</p>

If an object on one of those stacks caused the triggered ability to trigger, the player must put it on that stack. If a resolving spell or ability on one of those stacks causes a player to cast a spell or create a copy of a spell, the new spell must be put on the same stack.

Teammates may review each other’s hands and discuss strategies at any time. Teammates can’t manipulate each other’s cards or permanents.</p>
<p><a id="cr810.6"><b>810.6.</b></a> The team who plays first skips the draw step of its first turn.</p>
<p><a id="cr810.7"><b>810.7.</b></a> The Two-Headed Giant variant uses the combat rules for the shared team turns option (see rule <a href="#cr805.10">805.10</a>). This is a change from previous rules.</p>
<p><a id="cr810.8"><b>810.8.</b></a> The Two-Headed Giant variant uses the normal rules for winning or losing the game (see rule <a href="#cr104">104</a>), with the following additions and specifications.</p>
<p><a id="cr810.8a"><b>810.8a</b></a> Players win and lose the game only as a team, not as individuals. If either player on a team loses the game, the team loses the game. If either player on a team wins the game, the entire team wins the game. If an effect says that a player can’t win the game, that player’s team can’t win the game. If an effect says that a player can’t lose the game, that player’s team can’t lose the game.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> In a Two-Headed Giant game, a player controls Transcendence, which reads, in part, “You don’t lose the game for having 0 or less life.” If that player’s team’s life total is 0 or less, that team doesn’t lose the game.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> In a Two-Headed Giant game, a player attempts to draw a card while there are no cards in that player’s library. That player loses the game, so that player’s entire team loses the game.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> In a Two-Headed Giant game, a player controls Platinum Angel, which reads, “You can’t lose the game and your opponents can’t win the game.” Neither that player nor their teammate can lose the game while Platinum Angel is on the battlefield, and neither player on the opposing team can win the game.</p>
<p><a id="cr810.8b"><b>810.8b</b></a> If a player concedes, their team leaves the game immediately. That team loses the game.</p>
<p><a id="cr810.8c"><b>810.8c</b></a> If a team’s life total is 0 or less, the team loses the game. (This is a state-based action. See rule <a href="#cr704.">704.</a>)</p>
<p><a id="cr810.8d"><b>810.8d</b></a> If a team has fifteen or more poison counters, that team loses the game. (This is a state-based action. See rule <a href="#cr704.">704.</a>)</p>
<p><b>★</b> <a id="cr810.8e"><b>810.8e</b></a> If a team has fifteen or more glory counters, that team wins the game. (This is a state-based action. See rule <a href="#cr704.">704.</a>)</p>
<p><a id="cr810.9"><b>810.9.</b></a> Damage, loss of life, and gaining life happen to each player individually. The result is applied to the team’s shared life total.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> In a Two-Headed Giant game, a player casts Flame Rift, which reads, “Flame Rift deals 4 damage to each player.” Each team is dealt a total of 8 damage.</p>
<p><a id="cr810.9a"><b>810.9a</b></a> If a cost or effect needs to know the value of an individual player’s life total, that cost or effect uses the team’s life total instead.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> In a Two-Headed Giant game, a player on a team that has 17 life is targeted by Beacon of Immortality, which reads, in part, “Double target player’s life total.” That player gains 17 life, so the team winds up at 34 life.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> In a Two-Headed Giant game, a player controls Test of Endurance, an enchantment that reads, “At the beginning of your upkeep, if you have 50 or more life, you win the game.” At the beginning of that player’s upkeep, the player’s team wins the game if their team’s life total is 50 or more.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> In a Two-Headed Giant game, a player on a team that has 11 life controls Lurking Evil, an enchantment that reads, “Pay half your life, rounded up: Lurking Evil becomes a 4/4 Horror creature with flying.” To activate the ability, that player must pay 6 life. The team winds up at 5 life.</p>
<p><a id="cr810.9b"><b>810.9b</b></a> If a cost or effect allows both members of a team to pay life simultaneously, the total amount of life they pay may not exceed their team’s life total. (Players can always pay 0 life.)</p>
<p><a id="cr810.9c"><b>810.9c</b></a> If an effect sets a single player’s life total to a specific number, the player gains or loses the necessary amount of life to end up with the new total. The team’s life total is adjusted by the amount of life that player gained or lost.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> In a Two-Headed Giant game, a player on a team that has 25 life is targeted by an ability that reads, “Target player’s life total becomes 10.” That player’s life total is considered to be 25, so that player loses 15 life. The team winds up at 10 life.</p>
<p><a id="cr810.9d"><b>810.9d</b></a> If an effect would set the life total of each player on a team to a number, that team chooses one of its members. On that team, only that player is affected.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> In a Two-Headed Giant game, one team has 7 life and the other team has 13 life. A player casts Repay in Kind, which reads, “Each player’s life total becomes the lowest life total among all players.” Each team chooses one of its members to be affected. The result is that the chosen player on the team that has 13 life loses 6 life, so that team’s life total winds up at 7.</p>
<p><a id="cr810.9e"><b>810.9e</b></a> A player can’t exchange life totals with their teammate. If an effect would cause that to occur, the exchange won’t happen.</p>
<p><a id="cr810.9f"><b>810.9f</b></a> If an effect instructs a player to redistribute any number of players’ life totals, that player may not affect more than one member of each team this way.</p>
<p><a id="cr810.9g"><b>810.9g</b></a> If an effect says that a player can’t gain life, no player on that player’s team can gain life.</p>
<p><a id="cr810.9h"><b>810.9h</b></a> If an effect says that a player can’t lose life, no player on that player’s team can lose life or pay any amount of life other than 0.</p>
<p><a id="cr810.10"><b>810.10.</b></a> Effects that cause players to get poison counters happen to each player individually. The poison counters are shared by the team.</p>
<p><a id="cr810.10a"><b>810.10a</b></a> If an effect needs to know how many poison counters an individual player has, that effect uses the number of poison counters that player’s team has. If an effect needs to know how many poison counters a player’s opponents have, that effect uses the number of poison counters opposing teams have.</p>
<p><a id="cr810.10b"><b>810.10b</b></a> If an effect says that a player loses poison counters, that player’s team loses that many poison counters.</p>
<p><a id="cr810.10c"><b>810.10c</b></a> If an effect says that a player can’t get poison counters, no player on that player’s team can get poison counters.</p>
<p><a id="cr810.10d"><b>810.10d</b></a> If a rule or effect needs to know what kinds of counters an individual player has, that effect uses the kinds of counters that player has and the kinds of counters that player’s team has. A player is “poisoned” if that player’s team has one or more poison counters.</p>
<p><a id="cr810.11"><b>810.11.</b></a> The Two-Headed Giant variant can also be played with equally sized teams of more than two players. For each player a team has beyond the second, that team’s starting life total is increased by 15 and the number of poison counters required for the team to lose is increased by five. (These variants are called Three-Headed Giant, Four-Headed Giant, and so on.)</p>
<p><a id="cr811"><b>811. Alternating Teams Variant</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr811.1"><b>811.1.</b></a> Alternating Teams games are played with two or more teams of equal size.</p>
<p><a id="cr811.2"><b>811.2.</b></a> Any multiplayer options used are determined before play begins. The Alternating Teams variant uses the following default options.</p>
<p><a id="cr811.2a"><b>811.2a</b></a> The recommended range of influence is 2. See rule <a href="#cr801">801</a>, “Limited Range of Influence Option.”</p>
<p><a id="cr811.2b"><b>811.2b</b></a> Exactly one of the attack left, attack right, and attack multiple players options must be used. See rule <a href="#cr803">803</a>, “Attack Left and Attack Right Options,” and rule <a href="#cr802">802</a>, “Attack Multiple Players Option.”</p>
<p><a id="cr811.2c"><b>811.2c</b></a> The deploy creatures option isn’t normally used in the Alternating Teams variant.</p>
<p><a id="cr811.3"><b>811.3.</b></a> At the start of the game, players are seated so that no one is next to a teammate and each team is equally spaced out.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> In an Alternating Teams game with three teams, A, B, and C, the seating around the table at the start of the game is A1, B1, C1, A2, B2, C2, A3, B3, C3, and so on.</p>
<p><a id="cr811.4"><b>811.4.</b></a> A player can’t attack opponents who aren’t seated next to them.</p>
<p><a id="cr811.5"><b>811.5.</b></a> In the Alternating Teams variant, a team’s resources (cards in hand, mana, and so on) are not shared. Teammates can’t review each other’s hands unless they are sitting next to each other. Teammates may discuss strategies at any time. Teammates can’t manipulate each other’s cards or permanents.</p>
<a id="cr9"><b>9. Casual Variants</b></a><p><a id="cr900"><b>900. General</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr900.1"><b>900.1.</b></a> This section contains additional optional rules that can be used for certain casual game variants. It is by no means comprehensive.</p>
<p><a id="cr900.2"><b>900.2.</b></a> The casual variants detailed here use supplemental zones, rules, cards, and other game implements not used in traditional Magic games.</p>
<p><a id="cr901"><b>901. Planechase</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr901.1"><b>901.1.</b></a> In the Planechase variant, plane cards and phenomenon cards add additional abilities and randomness to the game. The Planechase variant uses all the normal rules for a Magic game, with the following additions.</p>
<p><a id="cr901.2"><b>901.2.</b></a> A Planechase game may be a two-player game or a multiplayer game. The default multiplayer setup is the Free-for-All variant with the attack multiple players option and without the limited range of influence option. See rule <a href="#cr806">806</a>, “Free-for-All Variant.”</p>
<p><a id="cr901.3"><b>901.3.</b></a> In addition to the normal game materials, each player needs a planar deck of at least ten plane and/or phenomenon cards and the game needs one planar die. No more than two cards in a planar deck can be phenomenon cards. Each card in a planar deck must have a different English name. (See rule <a href="#cr310">310</a>, “Planes,” and rule <a href="#cr311">311</a>, “Phenomena.”)</p>
<p><a id="cr901.3a"><b>901.3a</b></a> A planar die is a six-sided die. One face has the Planeswalker symbol {PW}. One face has the chaos symbol {CHAOS}. The other faces are blank.</p>
<p><a id="cr901.4"><b>901.4.</b></a> At the start of the game, each player shuffles their planar deck so that the cards are in a random order. Each deck is placed face down next to its owner’s library. All plane and phenomenon cards remain in the command zone throughout the game, both while they’re part of a planar deck and while they’re face up.</p>
<p><a id="cr901.5"><b>901.5.</b></a> Once all players have kept their opening hands and used the abilities of cards that allow them to take an action with those cards from their opening hands, the starting player moves the top card of their planar deck off that planar deck and turns it face up. If it’s a phenomenon card, the player puts that card on the bottom of their planar deck and repeats this process until a plane card is turned face up. (See rule <a href="#cr103.6">103.6</a>.) No abilities of any card turned face up this way trigger during this process. The face-up plane card becomes the starting plane.</p>
<p><a id="cr901.6"><b>901.6.</b></a> The owner of a plane or phenomenon card is the player who started the game with it in their planar deck. The controller of a face-up plane or phenomenon card is the player designated as the planar controller. Normally, the planar controller is whoever the active player is. However, if the current planar controller would leave the game, instead the next player in turn order that wouldn’t leave the game becomes the planar controller, then the old planar controller leaves the game. The new planar controller retains that designation until they leave the game or a different player becomes the active player, whichever comes first.</p>
<p><a id="cr901.7"><b>901.7.</b></a> Any abilities of a face-up plane card or phenomenon card in the command zone function from that zone. The card’s static abilities affect the game, its triggered abilities may trigger, and its activated abilities may be activated.</p>
<p><a id="cr901.7a"><b>901.7a</b></a> A face-up plane card or phenomenon card that’s turned face down becomes a new object.</p>
<p><a id="cr901.8"><b>901.8.</b></a> Planechase games have an inherent triggered ability known as the “planeswalking ability.” The full text of this ability is “Whenever you roll {PW}, planeswalk.” (See rule <a href="#cr701.24">701.24</a>, “Planeswalk.”) This ability has no source and is controlled by the player whose planar die roll caused it to trigger. This is an exception to rule <a href="#cr113.8">113.8</a>.</p>
<p><a id="cr901.9"><b>901.9.</b></a> Any time the active player has priority and the stack is empty, but only during a main phase of their turn, that player may roll the planar die. Taking this action costs a player an amount of mana equal to the number of times they have previously taken this action on that turn. This is a special action and doesn’t use the stack. Note that this number won’t be equal to the number of times the player has rolled the planar die that turn if an effect has caused the player to roll the planar die that turn. (See rule <a href="#cr116.2i">116.2i</a>.)</p>
<p><a id="cr901.9a"><b>901.9a</b></a> If the die roll is a blank face, nothing happens. The active player gets priority.</p>
<p><a id="cr901.9b"><b>901.9b</b></a> If the die roll is the chaos symbol {CHAOS}, any ability of a face-up plane that starts “When you roll {CHAOS}” triggers and is put on the stack. The active player gets priority.</p>
<p><a id="cr901.9c"><b>901.9c</b></a> If the die roll is the Planeswalker symbol {PW}, the “planeswalking ability” triggers and is put on the stack. The active player gets priority. (See rule <a href="#cr901.8">901.8</a>.)</p>
<p><a id="cr901.9d"><b>901.9d</b></a> Rolling the planar die will cause any ability that triggers whenever a player rolls one or more dice to trigger. However, any effect that refers to a numerical result of a die roll, including ones that compare the results of that roll to other rolls or to a given number, ignores the rolling of the planar die. See 706, “Rolling a Die.”</p>
<p><a id="cr901.10"><b>901.10.</b></a> When a player leaves the game, all objects owned by that player except abilities from phenomena leave the game. (See rule <a href="#cr800.4a">800.4a</a>.) If that includes a face-up plane card or phenomenon card, the planar controller turns the top card of their planar deck face up. This is not a state-based action. It happens as soon as the player leaves the game.</p>
<p><a id="cr901.10a"><b>901.10a</b></a> If a plane leaves the game while a “planeswalking ability” is on the stack, that ability ceases to exist.</p>
<p><a id="cr901.10b"><b>901.10b</b></a> Abilities from phenomena owned by a player who left the game remain on the stack controlled by the new planar controller.</p>
<p><a id="cr901.11"><b>901.11.</b></a> After the game has started, if a player moves the top card of their planar deck off that planar deck and turns it face up, that player has “planeswalked.” Continuous effects with durations that last until a player planeswalks end. Abilities that trigger when a player planeswalks trigger. See rule <a href="#cr701.24">701.24</a>.</p>
<p><a id="cr901.11a"><b>901.11a</b></a> A player may planeswalk as the result of the “planeswalking ability” (see rule <a href="#cr901.8">901.8</a>), because the owner of a face-up plane card or phenomenon card leaves the game (see rule <a href="#cr901.10">901.10</a>), or because a phenomenon’s triggered ability leaves the stack (see rule <a href="#cr704.6f">704.6f</a>). Abilities may also instruct a player to planeswalk.</p>
<p><a id="cr901.11b"><b>901.11b</b></a> The plane card that’s turned face up is the plane the player planeswalks to. The plane card or phenomenon card that’s turned face down, or that leaves the game, is the plane or phenomenon the player planeswalks away from.</p>
<p><a id="cr901.11c"><b>901.11c</b></a> If a player planeswalks when there is more than one face-up plane card, that player planeswalks away from all such planes.</p>
<p><a id="cr901.12"><b>901.12.</b></a> A Two-Headed Giant Planechase game uses all the rules for the Two-Headed Giant multiplayer variant and all the rules for the Planechase casual variant, with the following additions.</p>
<p><a id="cr901.12a"><b>901.12a</b></a> Each player has their own planar deck.</p>
<p><a id="cr901.12b"><b>901.12b</b></a> The planar controller is normally the primary player of the active team. However, if the current planar controller’s team would leave the game, instead the primary player of the next team in turn order that wouldn’t leave the game becomes the planar controller, then the old planar controller’s team leaves the game. The new planar controller retains that designation until they leave the game or a different team becomes the active team, whichever comes first.</p>
<p><a id="cr901.12c"><b>901.12c</b></a> Even though the face-up plane or phenomenon is controlled by just one player, any ability of that plane or phenomenon that refers to “you” applies to both members of the planar controller’s team.</p>
<p><a id="cr901.12d"><b>901.12d</b></a> Since each member of the active team is an active player, each of them may roll the planar die. Each player’s cost to roll the planar die is based on the number of times that particular player has already rolled the planar die that turn.</p>
<p><a id="cr901.13"><b>901.13.</b></a> In multiplayer formats other than Grand Melee, plane cards and phenomenon cards are exempt from the limited range of influence option. Their abilities, and the effects of those abilities, affect all applicable objects and players in the game. (See rule <a href="#cr801">801</a>, “Limited Range of Influence Option.”)</p>
<p><a id="cr901.14"><b>901.14.</b></a> In Grand Melee Planechase games, multiple plane cards or phenomenon cards may be face up at the same time.</p>
<p><a id="cr901.14a"><b>901.14a</b></a> Before the first turn of the game of the game, each player who will start the game with a turn marker sets a starting plane (see rule <a href="#cr901.5">901.5</a>). Each of them is a planar controller.</p>
<p><a id="cr901.14b"><b>901.14b</b></a> If a player would leave the game and that player leaving the game would reduce the number of turn markers in the game, that player first ceases to be a planar controller (but no other player becomes a planar controller), then that player leaves the game. Each face-up plane card or phenomenon card that player controlled is put on the bottom of its owner’s planar deck. No player is considered to have planeswalked.</p>
<p><a id="cr901.15"><b>901.15.</b></a> Single Planar Deck Option</p>
<p><a id="cr901.15a"><b>901.15a</b></a> As an alternative option, a Planechase game may be played with just a single communal planar deck. In that case, the number of cards in the planar deck must be at least forty or at least ten times the number of players in the game, whichever is smaller. The planar deck can’t contain more phenomenon cards than twice the number of players in the game. Each card in the planar deck must have a different English name.</p>
<p><a id="cr901.15b"><b>901.15b</b></a> In a Planechase game using the single planar deck option, the planar controller is considered to be the owner of all cards in the planar deck.</p>
<p><a id="cr901.15c"><b>901.15c</b></a> If any rule or ability refers to a player’s planar deck, the communal planar deck is used.</p>
<p><a id="cr902"><b>902. Vanguard</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr902.1"><b>902.1.</b></a> In the Vanguard variant, a vanguard card allows each player to play the role of a famous character. Each player will have one face-up vanguard card whose abilities and other characteristics affect the game. The Vanguard variant uses all the normal rules for a Magic game, with the following additions.</p>
<p><a id="cr902.2"><b>902.2.</b></a> A Vanguard game may be a two-player game or a multiplayer game.</p>
<p><a id="cr902.3"><b>902.3.</b></a> In addition to the normal game materials, each player needs a vanguard card. Each vanguard card is placed face up next to its owner’s library before the game begins. All vanguard cards remain in the command zone throughout the game.</p>
<p><a id="cr902.4"><b>902.4.</b></a> Each player’s starting life total is 20 plus or minus the life modifier of their vanguard card.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> The life modifier of a player’s vanguard card is -3. That player’s starting life total is 17.</p>
<p><a id="cr902.5"><b>902.5.</b></a> Each player’s starting hand size is seven cards, as modified by the hand modifier of their vanguard card.</p>
<p><a id="cr902.5a"><b>902.5a</b></a> If a player takes a mulligan in a Vanguard game, just like in a normal game, that player shuffles their hand back into their library, then draws a new hand equal to their starting hand size. (In a multiplayer game, a player’s first mulligan is for the same number of cards as they had before.) See rule <a href="#cr103.4">103.4</a>.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> The hand modifier of a player’s vanguard card is +2. That player starts the game with a hand of 9 cards. If the player takes a mulligan three times before keeping, they draw a new hand of nine cards and put three of those on the bottom of their library.</p>
<p><a id="cr902.5b"><b>902.5b</b></a> A player’s maximum hand size is seven, as modified by the hand modifier of their vanguard card.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> The hand modifier of a player’s vanguard card is -1. That player’s maximum hand size is six. If that player has more than six cards in their hand as their cleanup step begins, they will discard all but six of them.</p>
<p><a id="cr902.6"><b>902.6.</b></a> The owner of a vanguard card is the player who started the game with it in the command zone. The controller of a face-up vanguard card is its owner.</p>
<p><a id="cr902.7"><b>902.7.</b></a> Any abilities of a face-up vanguard card in the command zone function from that zone. The card’s static abilities affect the game, its triggered abilities may trigger, and its activated abilities may be activated.</p>
<p><a id="cr903"><b>903. Commander</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr903.1"><b>903.1.</b></a> In the Commander variant, each deck is led by a legendary creature designated as that deck’s commander. The Commander variant was created and popularized by fans; an independent rules committee maintains additional resources at MTGCommander.net. The Commander variant uses all the normal rules for a Magic game, with the following additions.</p>
<p><a id="cr903.2"><b>903.2.</b></a> A Commander game may be a two-player game or a multiplayer game. The default multiplayer setup is the Free-for-All variant with the attack multiple players option and without the limited range of influence option. See rule <a href="#cr806">806</a>, “Free-for-All Variant.”</p>
<p><a id="cr903.3"><b>903.3.</b></a> Each deck has a legendary creature card designated as its commander. This designation is not a characteristic of the object represented by the card; rather, it is an attribute of the card itself. The card retains this designation even when it changes zones.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> A commander that’s been turned face down (due to Ixidron’s effect, for example) is still a commander. A commander that’s copying another card (due to Cytoshape’s effect, for example) is still a commander. A permanent that’s copying a commander (such as a Body Double, for example, copying a commander in a player’s graveyard) is not a commander.</p>
<p><a id="cr903.3a"><b>903.3a</b></a> Some cards have an ability that states the card can be your commander. This ability modifies the rules for deck construction, and it functions before the game begins. See also rule <a href="#cr113.6n">113.6n</a>.</p>
<p><a id="cr903.3b"><b>903.3b</b></a> If a player’s commander is a meld card and it’s melded with the other member of its meld pair, the resulting melded permanent is that player’s commander.</p>
<p><a id="cr903.3c"><b>903.3c</b></a> If a player’s commander is a component of a merged permanent, the resulting merged permanent is that player’s commander.</p>
<p><a id="cr903.3d"><b>903.3d</b></a> If an effect refers to controlling a commander, it refers to a permanent on the battlefield that is a commander. If an effect refers to casting a commander, it refers to a spell that is a commander. If an effect refers to a commander in a specific zone, it refers to a card in that zone that is a commander.</p>
<p><a id="cr903.4"><b>903.4.</b></a> The Commander variant uses color identity to determine what cards can be in a deck with a certain commander. The color identity of a card is the color or colors of any mana symbols in that card’s mana cost or rules text, plus any colors defined by its characteristic-defining abilities (see rule <a href="#cr604.3">604.3</a>) or color indicator (see rule <a href="#cr204">204</a>).<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Bosh, Iron Golem is a legendary artifact creature with mana cost {8} and the ability “{3}{R}, Sacrifice an artifact: Bosh, Iron Golem deals damage equal to the sacrificed artifact’s mana value to any target.” Bosh’s color identity is red.</p>
<p><a id="cr903.4a"><b>903.4a</b></a> Color identity is established before the game begins.</p>
<p><a id="cr903.4b"><b>903.4b</b></a> If a commander has a static ability that causes a player to choose its color before the game begins, that choice applies during deck construction and throughout the game, even as the commander changes zones. That choice affects the commander’s color identity. The player reveals that choice as they put their commander into the command zone before the game begins. See rules <a href="#cr103.2c">103.2c</a> and <a href="#cr607.2p">607.2p</a>.</p>
<p><a id="cr903.4c"><b>903.4c</b></a> Reminder text is ignored when determining a card’s color identity. See rule <a href="#cr207.2">207.2</a>.</p>
<p><a id="cr903.4d"><b>903.4d</b></a> The back face of a double-faced card (see rule <a href="#cr712">712</a>) is included when determining a card’s color identity. This is an exception to rule <a href="#cr712.4a">712.4a</a>.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Civilized Scholar is the front face of a double-faced card with mana cost {2}{U}. Homicidal Brute is the back face of that double-faced card and has a red color indicator. The card’s color identity is blue and red.</p>
<p><a id="cr903.4e"><b>903.4e</b></a> If an ability refers to the colors or number of colors in a commander’s color identity, that quality is undefined if that player doesn’t have a commander. That part of the ability won’t do anything. Costs that refer to that quality are unpayable.</p>
<p><a id="cr903.5"><b>903.5.</b></a> Each Commander deck is subject to the following deck construction rules.</p>
<p><a id="cr903.5a"><b>903.5a</b></a> Each deck must contain exactly 100 cards, including its commander. In other words, the minimum deck size and the maximum deck size are both 100.</p>
<p><a id="cr903.5b"><b>903.5b</b></a> Other than basic lands, each card in a Commander deck must have a different English name. For the purposes of deck construction, cards with interchangeable names have the same English name (see rule <a href="#cr201.3">201.3</a>).</p>
<p><a id="cr903.5c"><b>903.5c</b></a> A card can be included in a Commander deck only if every color in its color identity is also found in the color identity of the deck’s commander.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Wort, the Raidmother is a legendary creature with mana cost {4}{R/G}{R/G}. Wort’s color identity is red and green. Each card in a Wort Commander deck must be only red, only green, both red and green, or have no color. Each mana symbol in the mana cost or rules text of a card in this deck must be only red, only green, both red and green, or have no color.</p>
<p><a id="cr903.5d"><b>903.5d</b></a> A card with a basic land type may be included in a Commander deck only if each color of mana it could produce is included in the commander’s color identity.<br><b><i>Example:</b></i> Wort, the Raidmother’s color identity is red and green. A Wort Commander deck may include land cards with the basic land types Mountain and/or Forest. It can’t include any land cards with the basic land types Plains, Island, or Swamp.</p>
<p><a id="cr903.6"><b>903.6.</b></a> At the start of the game, each player puts their commander from their deck face up into the command zone. Then each player shuffles the remaining 99 cards of their deck so that the cards are in a random order. Those cards become the player’s library.</p>
<p><a id="cr903.7"><b>903.7.</b></a> Once the starting player has been determined, each player sets their life total to 40 and draws a hand of seven cards.</p>
<p><a id="cr903.8"><b>903.8.</b></a> A player may cast a commander they own from the command zone. A commander cast from the command zone costs an additional {2} for each previous time the player casting it has cast it from the command zone that game. This additional cost is informally known as the “commander tax.”</p>
<p><a id="cr903.9"><b>903.9.</b></a> A commander may return to the command zone during a Commander game.</p>
<p><a id="cr903.9a"><b>903.9a</b></a> If a commander is in a graveyard or in exile and that object was put into that zone since the last time state-based actions were checked, its owner may put it into the command zone. This is a state-based action. See rule <a href="#cr704.">704.</a></p>
<p><a id="cr903.9b"><b>903.9b</b></a> If a commander would be put into its owner’s hand or library from anywhere, its owner may put it into the command zone instead. This replacement effect may apply more than once to the same event. This is an exception to rule <a href="#cr614.5">614.5</a>.</p>
<p><a id="cr903.9c"><b>903.9c</b></a> If a commander is a melded permanent or a merged permanent and its owner chooses to put it into the command zone using the replacement effect described in rule <a href="#cr903.9b">903.9b</a>, that permanent and each component representing it that isn’t a commander are put into the appropriate zone, and the card that represents it and is a commander is put into the command zone.</p>
<p><a id="cr903.10"><b>903.10.</b></a> The Commander variant includes the following specification for winning and losing the game. All other rules for ending the game also apply. (See rule <a href="#cr104.">104.</a>)</p>
<p><a id="cr903.10a"><b>903.10a</b></a> A player who’s been dealt 21 or more combat damage by the same commander over the course of the game loses the game. (This is a state-based action. See rule <a href="#cr704.">704.</a>)</p>
<p><a id="cr903.11"><b>903.11.</b></a> If a player is allowed to bring a card from outside the game into a Commander game, that player can’t bring a card into the game this way if it has the same name as a card that player had in their starting deck, if it has the same name as a card that the player owns in the current game, or if any color in its color identity isn’t in the color identity of the player’s commander.</p>
<p><a id="cr903.12"><b>903.12.</b></a> Brawl Option</p>
<p><a id="cr903.12a"><b>903.12a</b></a> Brawl is an option for a different style of Commander game. Brawl games use the normal rules for the Commander variant with the following modifications.</p>
<p><a id="cr903.12b"><b>903.12b</b></a> Brawl decks are usually constructed using cards from the Standard format.</p>
<p><a id="cr903.12c"><b>903.12c</b></a> A player designates either a legendary planeswalker or a legendary creature as their commander.</p>
<p><a id="cr903.12d"><b>903.12d</b></a> A player’s deck must contain exactly 60 cards, including its commander. In other words, the minimum deck size and the maximum deck size are both 60.</p>
<p><a id="cr903.12e"><b>903.12e</b></a> If a player’s commander has no colors in its color identity, that player’s deck may contain any number of basic lands of one basic land type of their choice. This is an exception to rule <a href="#cr903.5d">903.5d</a>.</p>
<p><a id="cr903.12f"><b>903.12f</b></a> In a two-player Brawl game, each player’s starting life total is 25. In a multiplayer Brawl game, each player’s starting life total is 30.</p>
<p><a id="cr903.12g"><b>903.12g</b></a> In any Brawl game, the first mulligan a player takes doesn’t count toward the number of cards that player will put on the bottom of their library or the number of mulligans that player may take. Subsequent mulligans are counted toward these numbers as normal.</p>
<p><a id="cr903.12h"><b>903.12h</b></a> Brawl games do not use the state-based action described in rule <a href="#cr704.6c">704.6c</a>, which causes a player to lose the game if they’ve been dealt 21 or more combat damage by a commander.</p>
<p><a id="cr903.13"><b>903.13.</b></a> Commander Draft</p>
<p><a id="cr903.13a"><b>903.13a</b></a> Commander Draft is an option for a different style of Commander game. It consists of a draft (a style of limited play where players choose cards from sealed booster packs to build their decks) followed by a multiplayer game. The Commander Draft option uses Commander Legends booster packs by default.</p>
<p><a id="cr903.13b"><b>903.13b</b></a> A draft typically consists of three draft rounds. In each draft round, each player opens a booster pack, drafts two cards by placing them in a face-down pile in front of them, then passes the remaining cards to the next player. Each player then drafts two cards from the booster pack passed to them and passes the remaining cards. This procedure continues until all cards in that draft round have been drafted.</p>
<p><a id="cr903.13c"><b>903.13c</b></a> In the first and third draft rounds, booster packs are passed to each player’s left. In the second draft round, booster packs are passed to each player’s right.</p>
<p><a id="cr903.13d"><b>903.13d</b></a> During the draft, a player can look only at cards in the booster pack they are currently drafting from and cards they have already drafted. A player may not reveal drafted cards to other players unless an ability instructs them to.</p>
<p><a id="cr903.13e"><b>903.13e</b></a> After the draft is complete, the cards a player drafted become that player’s card pool. A player may add up to two cards named The Prismatic Piper to their card pool, but only if those cards are used as the player’s commander(s).</p>
<p><a id="cr903.13f"><b>903.13f</b></a> Commander Draft deck construction follows the same rules as Commander deck construction (see rule <a href="#cr903.5">903.5</a>) with two exceptions: (1) A player’s deck must contain at least 60 cards. There is no maximum deck size. (2) A player’s deck may include any number of cards from that player’s card pool with the same name.</p>
<p><a id="cr903.13g"><b>903.13g</b></a> Commander Draft games follow the same rules as Commander games. See rules <a href="#cr903.6">903.6</a>–903.11.</p>
<p><a id="cr904"><b>904. Archenemy</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr904.1"><b>904.1.</b></a> In the Archenemy variant, a team of players faces off against a single opponent strengthened with powerful scheme cards. The Archenemy variant uses all the normal rules for a Magic game, with the following additions.</p>
<p><a id="cr904.2"><b>904.2.</b></a> The default setup for an Archenemy game is the Team vs. Team multiplayer variant (see rule <a href="#cr808">808</a>) involving exactly two teams. The attack multiple players option (see rule <a href="#cr802">802</a>) and the shared team turns option (see rule <a href="#cr805">805</a>) are used; no other multiplayer options are used.</p>
<p><a id="cr904.2a"><b>904.2a</b></a> One of the teams consists of exactly one player, who is designated the archenemy.</p>
<p><a id="cr904.2b"><b>904.2b</b></a> The other team consists of any number of players.</p>
<p><a id="cr904.3"><b>904.3.</b></a> In addition to the normal game materials, the archenemy needs a scheme deck of at least twenty scheme cards. A scheme deck may contain no more than two of any card with a particular English name. (See rule <a href="#cr313">313</a>, “Schemes.”)</p>
<p><a id="cr904.4"><b>904.4.</b></a> At the start of the game, the archenemy shuffles their scheme deck so that the cards are in a random order. The scheme deck is placed face down next to the archenemy’s library. All scheme cards remain in the command zone throughout the game, both while they’re part of a scheme deck and while they’re face up.</p>
<p><a id="cr904.5"><b>904.5.</b></a> The archenemy’s starting life total is 40. Each other player’s starting life total is 20.</p>
<p><a id="cr904.6"><b>904.6.</b></a> Rather than a randomly determined player, the archenemy takes the first turn of the game.</p>
<p><a id="cr904.7"><b>904.7.</b></a> The owner of a scheme card is the player who started the game with it in the command zone. The controller of a face-up scheme card is its owner.</p>
<p><a id="cr904.8"><b>904.8.</b></a> Any abilities of a face-up scheme card in the command zone function from that zone. The card’s static abilities affect the game, its triggered abilities may trigger, and its activated abilities may be activated.</p>
<p><a id="cr904.9"><b>904.9.</b></a> Immediately after the archenemy’s precombat main phase begins during each of their turns, that player moves the top card of their scheme deck off that scheme deck and turns it face up. This is called “setting that scheme in motion.” (See rule <a href="#cr701.25">701.25</a>.) This turn-based action doesn’t use the stack. Abilities of that scheme card that trigger “When you set this scheme in motion” trigger.</p>
<p><a id="cr904.10"><b>904.10.</b></a> If a non-ongoing scheme card is face up in the command zone, and no triggered abilities of any scheme are on the stack or waiting to be put on the stack, that scheme card is turned face down and put on the bottom of its owner’s scheme deck the next time a player would receive priority. (This is a state-based action. See rule <a href="#cr704.">704.</a>)</p>
<p><a id="cr904.11"><b>904.11.</b></a> Once an ongoing scheme card is set in motion, it remains face up in the command zone until an ability causes it to be abandoned (see rule <a href="#cr701.26">701.26</a>).</p>
<p><a id="cr904.12"><b>904.12.</b></a> Supervillain Rumble Option</p>
<p><a id="cr904.12a"><b>904.12a</b></a> As an alternative option, players may play a Free-for-All game in which each player has their own scheme deck. The attack multiple players option (see rule <a href="#cr802">802</a>) is used; no other multiplayer options are used.</p>
<p><a id="cr904.12b"><b>904.12b</b></a> Each player in this game is an archenemy.</p>
<p><a id="cr904.12c"><b>904.12c</b></a> As in a normal Free-for-All game, the starting player is randomly determined. All other rules that apply to the archenemy in an Archenemy game apply to each player in a Supervillain Rumble game.</p>
<p><a id="cr905"><b>905. Conspiracy Draft</b></a></p>
<p><a id="cr905.1"><b>905.1.</b></a> The Conspiracy Draft variant consists of a draft (a style of limited play where players choose cards from sealed booster packs to build their decks) followed by a multiplayer game. The Conspiracy Draft variant uses Magic: The Gathering—Conspiracy™ and/or Conspiracy: Take the Crown™ booster packs by default.</p>
<p><a id="cr905.1a"><b>905.1a</b></a> A draft typically consists of three draft rounds. In each draft round, each player opens a booster pack, drafts one card by placing that card in a face-down pile in front of the player, then passes the remaining cards to the next player. Each player then drafts a card from the booster pack passed to them and passes the remaining cards. This procedure continues until all cards in that draft round have been drafted.</p>
<p><a id="cr905.1b"><b>905.1b</b></a> In the first and third draft rounds, booster packs are passed to each player’s left. In the second draft round, booster packs are passed to each player’s right.</p>
<p><a id="cr905.1c"><b>905.1c</b></a> During the draft, a player can look only at cards in the booster pack they are currently drafting from, cards they have already drafted, cards that are currently revealed as described in rule <a href="#cr905.2b">905.2b</a>, and cards that have been drafted face up as described in rule <a href="#cr905.2c">905.2c</a>. A player may not reveal drafted cards to other players unless an ability instructs them to.</p>
<p><a id="cr905.1d"><b>905.1d</b></a> After the draft and all actions that may be taken during or after the draft, all the cards a player has drafted become that player’s card pool. The player builds their deck from only these cards and any number of basic land cards. See rules <a href="#cr100.2b">100.2b</a> and <a href="#cr100.4b">100.4b</a>.</p>
<p><a id="cr905.2"><b>905.2.</b></a> Some cards have abilities that function during the draft.</p>
<p><a id="cr905.2a"><b>905.2a</b></a> During a draft, there is no active player or system of priority. If multiple players wish to take an action at the same time during the draft and can’t agree on an order, those actions are taken in a random order.</p>
<p><a id="cr905.2b"><b>905.2b</b></a> Some cards instruct players to reveal them as they’re drafted and then note some information, such as a number or color. This information can be referred to by other abilities during the game. Any player can look at this information at any time during the draft or game. After the information is noted, the drafted card is turned face down and added to the player’s drafted cards pile.</p>
<p><a id="cr905.2c"><b>905.2c</b></a> Some cards instruct players to draft them face up. Each such card remains face up until the draft is complete, an effect instructs the person who drafted it to turn it face down, or the card leaves that player’s drafted cards pile. While the card is face up, all players may look at it.</p>
<p><a id="cr905.3"><b>905.3.</b></a> A Conspiracy Draft game is a multiplayer game. The default multiplayer setup is the Free-for-All variant with the attack multiple players option and without the limited range of influence option. See rule <a href="#cr806">806</a>, “Free-for-All Variant.”</p>
<p><a id="cr905.4"><b>905.4.</b></a> At the start of the game, before decks are shuffled, each player may put any number of conspiracy cards from their sideboard into the command zone.</p>
<p><a id="cr905.4a"><b>905.4a</b></a> Conspiracy cards with hidden agenda are put into the command zone face down. Any time a player has priority, they may turn a face-down conspiracy card they control face up. See rule <a href="#cr702.106">702.106</a>, “Hidden Agenda.”</p>
<p><a id="cr905.5"><b>905.5.</b></a> The owner of a conspiracy card is the player who put it into the command zone at the start of the game. The controller of a conspiracy card is its owner.</p>
<p><a id="cr905.6"><b>905.6.</b></a> Once the starting player has been determined, each player sets their life total to 20 and draws a hand of seven cards.</p>
